Newman.\n\n\nChapter I\n\n\nA finer estate than that of Joshua Sowers could not be found in all Virginia. We will not give the exact date, let it suffice for us to say we begin our story April the first, in a certain part of the nineteenth century. \n\n\nThe morning was a clear, beautiful one, We locate the scene of our story in the county of Frederick, a short distance from the then small town of Winchester. The estate was rightly named Brookland, for the land was covered with brooks. Mr. Sowers owned a large mill. It had had stood the storms of many years, and, to tell the truth, the old mill was beginning to look “rickety.”\n\n\nThrough the centre of the estate flowed the largest stream, and it was of so much importance as to receive the name of “Abram’s creek.”\n\n\nHalf a mile west of the mill there was a “dam” made in the creek; then a “race” or small canal led the water down to the \n\n\n\n\n[PAGE 2: SC0313_Ms_004]\n\n\nmill, where it was used to run the great water-wheel, and then it was free again. Enough of this. We will see who the inhabitants of Brookland are.\n\n\nTwo young men are sauntering along the road that leads to the country church, which is about one mile from Brookland.\n\n\nWe will first describe them, and then listen at what they are talking about. Both had dark hair, dark eyes and fair complexion; they were tall and well built. They were so near alike that this was the common question asked as they passed a stranger: “Aren’t they brothers?” The answer was always “no,” if an acquaintance was near. Then the questioner would remark: “Well they are the best lookin’ “pine-hillers” I ever saw!”\n\n\nNow for what those two young men are talking about. We must also choose a hero from these two “pine-hillers.”\n\n\n“This is my last day at Brookland,” said one of the young men, and as he speaks honestly, we choose him as our hero. His name is William G. Reed. “I will start to Chicago tomorrow morning. I must go away from here, as I am making nothing.” \n\n\n“That’s so William,” said William’s companion Albert King by name. \n\n\n[PAGE 3: SC0313_Ms_005]\n\n\nNow for what those two young men are talking about. We must also choose a hero from these two “Pine hillers.”\n\n\n“This is my last day at Brookland,” said one of the young men, as he speaks honestly, we choose him as our hero. his name is William G. Reed. “I shall start for Chicago tomorrow morning. I must go away from here, for I am making nothing here.” \n\n\n“That is so Will.” said William’s companion Albert King by name. “I ought to go but mother isn’t willing for me to go.” \n\n\n“Well, Albert, abide by what your mother says.” advised our hero. “If I had a mother I would obey her in all things.”\n\n\nPoor William! He had never known a mother, he had been partially raised in Berryville by a man he thought was his father, Wilson Reed by name. There was some mystery connected with his parentage, a mystery he could not solve.\n\n\nHe was an amiable young man, much respected by all who knew him. Our hero and his companion were at last in sight of the church. Albert stopped suddenly and seemed to be in\n \n[PAGE 4: SC0313_Ms_006]\n\n\ndeep thought then he said: “I don’t care about going in to church so I will take a stroll down through the woods I may walke up to Winchester. ‘So long’ William, I’ll see you this evening.” So saying, the young man was off through the woods, before his friend could say a word more than “good bye, Al.”\n\n\nTo state the truth Albert King was contemplating some deep project and wished to be alone with his thoughts.. he was a gentleman in appearance. Whether he was a gentleman in principle or not, we shall find out bye-and-bye.\n\n\nWe will not follow Albert in his wanderings for awhile. We will see what our hero is about. Arriving at the church he concluded he would sit down awhile under a large tree hard by, for the simple purpose of watching for a young lady he expected to see. He loved this young lady and he intended to tell her of his love before he left Brookland. He was compelled to ask her that day if she returned his love for he was to start for Chicago on the following day. he seated himself under the tree in question and “watched and waited” to see\n\n\n[PAGE 5: SC0313_Ms_007]\n\n\nhis lady love. After awhile he saw her coming on horse-back he rose and went forward to meet her. Cordial greetings were soon exchanged and they walked into the church. After services were over William asked his lady to walk down to Mrs. Barton’s residence with him She consented to go. Mrs. Barton’s residence was at Brookland. William boarded at her house. The lovers walked leisurely down to Brookland. William’s heart was throbbing fast. \n\n\n         “Willie I am sorry you are going away.” asserted Ella Armstead – for such was the lady’s name. \n\n\n“You are still determined to go?” \n\n\n“I am still determined to go.” answered William. “But I hate to go.” –he grasped Ella’s hand as he spoke. She didn’t attempt to withdraw her hand. “Miss Armstead – Ella – dear – Ella. Will you try to love me? I love you with all my heart. Will you try to love me? a little?”\n\n\n“I do love you dear Willie,” answered Ella passionately. “I love you as well as woman can love man. I am so sorry you are going away. I will feel so very lon lonesome while you are away.”\n\n\n[PAGE 6: SC0313_Ms_008]\n\n\n“I must go love.” said William as he clasped Ella to his breast.\n\n\nThey arrived at Brookland. after a slow walk. the day passed pleasantly, with William and Ella. Late in the evening William accompanied Ella home and reluctantly bid her farewell at the gate. \n\n\n “Are you going to write to me Willie?” inquired Ella as she stood as the yard-gate. \n \n“I don’t know whether I will or not.” said William. “I may go to California” \n\n\n“Well come back as soon as you can.” asserted Ella. “I want you to stay so bad! Oh Willie can’t you stay?”\n\n\n“I cannot stay dear.” said William as he and Ella walked down the lane. They stopped under a large willow tree and William pressed her to his bosom. in the twilight of the evening he bid her farewell.\n\n\nHis heart was too full for utterance, so he gave her a loving kiss and unwillingly started for Brookland. Oh! how his heart ached as he walked briskly along toward Brookland he felt a a presentiment that he would not n never meet her again. Will he realize his presentiment? We trust not. When he arrived at Mrs. Barton’s his supper was ready, and he sat\n\n\n[PAGE 7: SC0313_Ms_009]\n\n\nDown and tryed to Eat. he ate very little supper; in the course of the repast he said: “Mrs. Barton have you seen Al since morning I forgot to ask you while Ella was here he said he would go up to town with me tonight. I will stay at the Taylor Hotel tonight – I wish he was here he seems to be my Best friend”\n\n\nLittle did William Reed think what an enemy he had in the person of Albert King.[÷] We anticipate not But wish Willie God speed. “No Willie”. said mrs Barton “Al has not Been here and let me caution my Boy not to trust so much in Alberts’ friendship I have several times noticed him looking at you an Evil gleam of hate in his Eyes”\n\n\n“Oh! Pshaw! mother Barton I know Al he always treated me well we have been Pals for two years” and William honest hearted Willie thought mrs Barton had done Al a serious injury [÷]  “Willie” said mrs Barton I saw some one strolling around the mill today I don’t know But what they were at some\n\n\n[PAGE 8: SC0313_Ms_010]\n\n\nmischief.” William looked surprised. “Mr Sowers and family were away all day were they not?” inquired William. \n\n\n“Yes they have been away all day” replied Mrs. Barton.\n\n\n“Well where is Kate today or night?” inquired William. “Strange they are all away at once. has she gone out visiting?”\n\n\n“Yes. She is off somewhere” answered Mrs. Barton. “She has been away all day.”\n\n\n“Well I wish Al was here” said William as he arose from the table – “Will you let your boy harness up a horse and take my trunk in to Winchester?”\n\n\n“Certainly I will” said Mrs. Barton. “Joe get the horse and wagon ready.”\n \n“Yes Joe get it quick please. and I will give you half a dollar” asserted William.\n\n\n“All right sah I will get ’em pretty quick.” said Joe as he started off, greatly delighted to hear of receiving a reward for for his services.\n\n\n“There you are Kate” said Mrs Barton as Kate at that moment came in. Kate was a flaxen haired sensible (?) girl. knew a little too much. “Where have you\n\n\n[PAGE 9: SC0313_Ms_011]\n\n\nbeen all day? enjoying yourself somewhere? Well eat your supper for it is getting late.” \n “Old lady” said Kate to herself after Mrs. Barton went out “You are not aware of the fact that I am playing a ___________”\n\n\nShe did not finish the sentence for she was afraid she might be heard by some one. William came in to bid all of Mrs. Barton’s family farewell. he bade them farewell and then went to the mill to get his trunk ready. While he is there or on his way there we will give a description of Ella Armstead. \n\n\nShe had raven tresses; that hung in pretty ringlets around her plump face. She had a beautiful complexion and was just the size to look sweet.\n\n\nWilliam went into his room at the mill and proceeded to the desk; not noticing his trunk at the time. But he noticed the window being hoisted; he then looked around at his trunk. what was his surprise when he perceived It was wide open; and his clothes was thrown out of It. The trunk was literally “ransacked.”\n\n\nHe went to his trunk peremptorily, and began placing his things in his trunk again\n        \n[PAGE 10: SC0313_Ms_012]\n\n\nWhile he is fixing his effects we will visit Ella : She proceed to her the house as soon as William was out of sight. She had fearful forebodings that she would never see her “dear Willie.” again\n\n\nShe blushingly told her mother of the promise she had made to William.\n “I hope you will keep your promise Ella” was all her mother said.\n “I will do so mother as long as I live. I shall never lose faith in William”\n “That is the way to talk Ella” said her mother approvingly.\n\n\nThe time intervening between sunset and bedtime soon passes with country people.\n Their motto is: “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” In most all cases country people stand to that rule, still there are some exceptions to all rules. Mr. Armstead and family retired early, as they expected to rise early the next morning.\n\n\nElla was thinking of William all that evening. So when She went to her room and prepared for bed she knelt, [as?]\nwas her custom, and prayed to the [Page torn; content missing]\nof all good. Prayed long and earnes[tly for?][b]\nthe welfare of her lover. We will [presently?]\n\n\n[PAGE 11: SC0313_Ms_013]\n\n\nsee what “her lover” is doing.\n\n\nHe placed his clothes in his trunk. he looked earnestly, but vainly for his best suit of clothes, they could not be found. his best shoes were also missing.\n\n\n“Who could have taken my clothes?” William asked himself. “Some one has stolen my best suit of clothes, two shirts, and low quartered shoes. Well that beats all I ever witnessed. I’ll say nothing about it to any-one as it will do no good to tell them now as the clothes are gone.” So saying, he locked his trunk and carried it out on the mill porch.\n\n\nJoe soon had the wagon there, so, William put his trunk in and told Joe to drive on, pretty lively as he wished to get to town as soon as he could. Arriving at Winchester, at the “Taylor Hotel,” William gave Joe an ample reward for his services. William then went into the hotel. he had a room engaged, so, he went immediately up to it. he soon went to bed, he slept well and rose early. went immediately to the depot had his trunk checked and also\n\n\n[PAGE 12: SC0313_Ms_014]\n\n\n\n\ngot procured his ticket. he took his seat just as the cars moved off from the depot. “I do wish I could have seen Albert before I started.” asserted William to himself. “I ought to have went up to Loudon Street and seen Mrs. King. Perhaps Albert was at home. Whoever It was that stole my clothes I hope they will never do any good with them. Mrs. Barton’s words were strange, very strange. I never thought Albert was my enemy. I can’t believe it now, for, he has always treated me right.”\n\n\nIt was too late for William to wish now, for the “Iron horse” was fast carrying him away, far away from those he loved. he was being carried to a good or evil destiny. It is hard to tell whether it was good or evil.\n\n\nOn, on sped the train, and so we part from William, to see him no more until returns. We go back to Brookland, and presumptously enter the proprietor’s house.\n\n\nWe find him in bed. Listen! \n\n\nWhat does he say as he opens his eyes?\n\n\n[PAGE 13: SC0313_Ms_015]\n\n\nChapter II\n\n\n“Well, it is five o’clock and I don’t hear the mill going. I did not see Albert at all last night, perhaps he stayed in town. however, I’ll go down to the mill and see what is up.” “Let see” he added “this is the second day of April” Our friends may imgine imagine who the “He” was it was mr Joshua Sowers owner of The Brookland mills he was so used to hearing the mill running that he would quickly in the midnight if the mill stopped he would quickly perceive that it had he went softly down stairs and on down to the mill as he reached the door of the mill he met his wagoner – in our first chapter [Page torn, most likely “h”][c]e[d] did not tell our readers that Wilson Reed was employed as wagoner for mr Sowers But such was the case– “good morning Wilson” said mr Sowers “have you seen anything of mr King this morning”\n“no sir I have not” said Wilson doggedly It seemed that Wilson Reed held a secret [Page torn, most likely “po”]wer over mr Sowers\n\n\n[PAGE 14: SC0313_Ms_016]\n\n\nafter mr Sowers had started the mill and got his Breakfast he started off to Winchester while he is on his way to Winchester we will avail ourselves of the opportunity of describing him and his family.\n\n\nHe was a man of very muscular physique he was about sixty years of age his hair was an iron gray he was also dressed in his regular millers’ shirt his wife was near the same age and was a fine robust woman for her age he had a daughter an only child a girl who had long since passed sweet sixteen yet she was very Beautiful She had Blue Eyes and her hair formed a striking contrast with her Eyes for her hair was a Dark Brown.\n\n\nWhen mr. Sowers reached town he ^(went)[e] to Albert King’s home and enquired of his mother if she had seen Albert anywhere or if he had stayed there all night and was indisposed [÷]\n\n\n“No Sir” said mrs King “he is not here nor did he stay all night he was here yesterday about ten o’clock he put some clothes in his valise and said he would take them to the mill with him I hope he has not met with any Bad luck”\n\n\n[PAGE 15: SC0313_Ms_017]\n\n\nmr. Sowers returned home in a very bad humor when he reached his gate he called his faithful servant Jack to put his horse away. Jack came out of the Barn looking verry pale for a colored man.\n\n\n“Jack why don’t you hurry up you’ve been drunk again and I’ll not put up with it any longer” “and” he added “as soon as you put that horse away come to me and I will settle with you.”\n\n\nJack put the horse in the stable and he didn’t seem to be in a hurry to go to his master when he at last started for the house he said “yes I am determined to argefy dis case wid Old Marster Joshua. de only way to get out of dis scrape is to argefy de case wid him.” So he walked to where his master was standing cow-hide in hand to whip him Jack stopped a little out of reach of the cow-hide and began to ‘argefy’ the case as he called it\n\n\n“Now master Joshua” began Jack “now look a heah you aint gwine to whip poor old Jack are you? I have been a good sarvint only I does drink a little too much sometimes”\n\n\n[PAGE 16: SC0313_Ms_018]\n\n\nmr. Sowers began to grow restive and he said “Now Jack I want none of your trying to beg off you have done that too often now I am not going to think it over or talk it over with you but I am going to give you a genteel cowhiding so come closer so I can hit you” mr Sowers waited for Jack to come closer but Jack wasn’t coming any closer--not fast\n\n\n“now mars Joshua” began Jack again jist let me and you argefy dis case jist for de sake of argificashun you has knowed me a long while I have knowed you a long while you are Marster Joshua Sowers and I aint nothing but old Jack but we must argefy dis case” here Jack stopped and looked in his master’s face to see if his words had any influence on his master he had not long to wait for his master was in a bad humor\n\n\n“Jack I am tired of this foolishness” said mr Sowers “So come here and let me whip you or shall I have you whipped at the whipping post in Winchester”\n\n\nJack did not like to hear of the whipping post so he was more determined than ever\n\n\n[PAGE 17: SC0313_Ms_019]\n\n\nto argufy his case so he stood still and said:\n\n\n“now mars Joshua let me argefy jist dis one case you come out here and be old Jack and let me stand in de gate as Marster Joshua Sowers jist for a little while until I show you what I mean by argeficashun” Sowers began to get more impatient But in order to see what old Jack was up to he accordingly changed places with old Jack giving Jack the cowhide so Jack took his place in the gate as master Sowers and began talking to his master in this style [÷]\n\n\n“now come in heah you old nigger you! I ought to trash de very skin off you but you have been a good sarvint only de fault of drinking too much you tink I gwine to whip you arter you been wid me so long and been such a faithful sarvint Eh? Umph? no I see you dam frist [f]but you come in heah you rottin mortal herrin? an behave yourself in de futeer and I’ll not whip you. you yoller rascal but you aint even yoller you are black”\n\n\n[PAGE 18: SC0313_Ms_020]\n\n\nSowers was so completely amused at his old servant’s way of argufying the case that he had a long and hearty laugh and he never gave himself any more trouble about old Jack Old Jack was incorrigible [÷]\n\n\nWhile old Jack and his master were argufying, another scene was being enacted in the kitchen Kate Barton was in the kitchen she had been told to stay away from there a good many times but she did not heed the order so as it always was in Virginia those who do not heed the law must be punished by the law and aunt Sally was argufying the case with Kate She was saying \n\n\n“now Kate you have come heah agin an’ you know dat marse an’ missus dont want you heah we dem dont any ov us want you heah we dem are ‘ristocractic genemen and Ladies we dem dont want any poor trash a pryin’ roun’ heah nuther” and Aunt Sally walked proudly across the floor to the stove to look at her roast of Beef pot of cabbage &c. &c. about this time young miss Sowers came in and Kate ran to meet her and Bid her goodmorning\n[PAGE 19: SC0313_Ms_021]\n\n\n^(good) morning But she met with a cold reception from miss mattie Sowers shortly after this she returned home as she slowly sauntered along ^(she) said in a low voice scarcely above a whisper “I will have my revenge”\n\n\nWhom could she have been contemplating a revenge on? We shall see [÷]\n\n\nIt was now dinner time and Wilson Reed proceeded to the fine house of mr. Sowers to get his dinner why he always Boarded at Old Sowers house was more than anyone could find out But it made no difference whether there was company or no company at the house he always Boarded there as he came out from his dinner his employer came out too and they both went to the mill together as the neared the mill Sowers began talking of some game he was playing:\n\n\n“Wilse” says Sowers “I hope you have never Breathed a word about –That– well you know what I don’t like to speak it for Rocks have Ears sometimes if you have!”\n\n\n[PAGE 20: SC0313_Ms_022]\n\n\n“If I have what are you going to do about it?” fired up Wilse “I want you to recollect Josh Sowers that if I was not to be heard of or was to be missing it would not take long to bring you to justice”\n\n\nAfter a short pause he added “I have got papers in the hands of certain persons that would Bring you lower than your old dog! Josh Sowers I am and have been playing a deep game for you and dont you threaten me or By Heavens : I shall tell all”\n\n\nJoshua Sowers upon hearing this turned as white as a ghost and trembled like a leaf\n\n\n“My goodness Wilse” said he “dont speak so loud I didn’t threaten you or did I think of such a thing” and he tried to smile but it was a very faint smile\n\n\n“I was with you when you administered that dose—” “hush Wilse or I’ll shoot you in your tracks!” and mr Sowers was trying hard to conceal his rage. But Wilse Reed was very cool\n\n\n“Oh now if my other unfinished sentence scared you so much how will this one act” \nSaid Wilse Reed unconcernedly.\n\n\n[PAGE 21: SC0313_Ms_023]\n\n\n“I say how will this sentence act? I went with you to the graveyard and helped—”\n\n\nat this juncture Joshua Sowers nearly fainted But by a power almost superhuman he controlled himself and fell on his knees to Wilse and asked him to say no more\n\n\n“oh Wilson I beg you to hush please have mercy don’t expose me to the world have mercy have mercy!” here he Broke down with Sobs but Wilse Reed took it all coolly after a while he said to Sowers: \n\n\n“Come get up Joshua I’ll say no more I see you comprehend how fully I have got you in my power I was only going to say I helped you to”––––” before he could finish his sentence Joshua Sowers fell as if dead for glancing up through the Bushes before him he saw a female figure crouching down as if listening at him and Wilse Reed\n\n\nWilse bathed his head in cold water and soon brought him “around.” They soon reached the mill after this. Joshua Sowers was ill at ease\n\n\n[PAGE 22: SC0313_Ms_024]\n\n\nWhen Kate reached home her mother had dinner ready when they were seated at the table her mother asked in her usual way:\n\n\n“Kate has Albert King returned yet or has he been heard of”?\n“No indeed mother he aint come back yet and Mr Sowers is in a very bad humor about it him and Jack had a time of it but he didn’t whip Jack” answered Kate but she didn’t tell her mother what a time she and aunt Sally had, had she didn’t stay long at home before she was off again a short distance above their house was a ledge of rocks on this ledge was a lot of Bushes and below this ledge was the road leading to the mill and there was a path on this ledge beyond the bushes Kate thought she would take this path and as she proceeded along she heard voices she recognized one as Wilse Reed’s The other was so plaintive she didn’t know it and thinking ‘twas no harm to eavesdrop as she had done many time before she crouched in the bushes and listened but she could not catch a word as there was a breeze blowing it wafted the voices onward she finally got up and started on\n\n\n[PAGE 23: SC0313_Ms_025]\n\n\ntoward mr Sowers’ house and as we have neglected Mrs. and Miss Sowers so long we will turn our attention to them as Kate enters. when Kate entered Mrs. Sowers’ kitchen she was received as coolly as ever but she wouldn’t be thwarted in her plans so she put on her blandest smile and commenced her prate:\n\n\n“Why good evening Mrs. Sowers how are you and how did you enjoy yourself yesterday and how was all the people at Spout Springs.” There is no telling how long she would have run on this if she had not been interrupted by Joe running in and telling her that a young Lady from the vicinity of Greenwood wanted her to spend the evening with her at This lady’s home so she went with the Lady\n\n\nafter she had been gone about an hour aunt Sally began to relieve her brain of so much weight so she told mrs Sowers of her treatment to Kate in the morning. finally supper time came and after supper they all went in the parlor to sit awhile.\n\n\n[PAGE 24: SC0313_Ms_026]\n\n\nabout nine o’clock they all went to bed miss mattie went to her room and sat awhile to read She didn’t have a chamber maid so she undressed and went to bed she soon fell asleep little thinking that an intended assassin was lurking in her room She had a strange dream She dreamed some one was standing over her a gleam of deadly hate in their ^(eyes) and a knife in hand ready to plunge it deep in her heart She could not move neither hand nor foot she tried to speak to beg for her life or scream and arouse the house all was of no avail for some length of time finally she succeeded in moving and opened her eyes and for some time she was speechless with terror to wake out of a dream a horrible dream only to have it verified to wake only to realize the seeming horror in her dream for there standing over her bed was a person masked and raising a knife to deal her a deadly blow! She raised up and gave one deafening scream and fell back unconscious on her bed!\n\n\n[PAGE 25: SC0313_Ms_027]\nChapter III\n\n\n\n\nIn the preceding chapter we said that mr Sowers and Wilse Reed reached the mill Shortly after their talk beneath the ledge well mr Sower stayed at at the mill until supper time. Wilse Reed went to Winchester that evening with a load of flour as soon as Wilse was off mr Sowers went in his office and sat down and fell into a said sad reverie finally he roused himself and began in a low voice thus [÷]\n\n\n“I wish oh! I wish I had never done it [I] have put myself in Wilse Reed’s power Oh\n[m]y god if I had my days to live over [Page torn; content missing] from 1820 up to the present time. I have [had?] my heart gna gnawed with a guilty conscience all for revenge She proved false to me and I was mad when I took Wilse Reed to help me carry out my feindish[g] plans Then to think of going to a graveyard Oh to think of it makes me miserable. miserable”! he got up and paced the floor for a long time looking out of the window about five o’clock he saw his wagoner coming he controlled his feelings as best he could could\n\n\n[PAGE 26: SC0313_Ms_028]\n\n\nby the time Wilse came in the office.\n\n\n“Well Wilse” said Sowers “you said you had a proposition to make come out with it”\n\n\n“Well Josh meet me at midnight under the ledge the man I have got employed will be there at precisely eleven o’clock you meet me at twelve and I will tell you of the proposition I have to make come prepared for money is [th]e object in all transactions if you had done as I told you twenty-two years ago you would have forgg forgotten it all by this time” as Wilse said this he eyed his master or rather his employer furtively to see the effect of his words\n\n\n“Well Wilse it is too late to talk about what might have been done what I do now is not for revenge but to hide my first deviltry” here a look of pain passed over his face and he added “Oh Wilson to think of it makes me so miserable when we were talking beneath the ledge I saw a woman on the ledge sitting still as if listening at us” at hearing this Wilse Reed’s face became ashy pale however he said doggedly \n\n\n“If I catch anyone eavesdropping me I’ll [Page torn; Content missing] blow their Brains out!” and thus they parted.\n\n\n[PAGE 27: SC0313_Ms_029]\n\n\nMr Sowers started toward his fine house and he was trying hard to conceal his inner feelings they had a colored boy living with them belonging to the class called free negroes. his name was George and as mr Sowers reached his kitchen door he asked for George aunt Sally said “indeed marse Sowers I don’t know where he is these nasty lazy free niggahs is so cunnin’ dey are always hidin’ to keep from deir work but marse Joshua what is de matter honey you look so drefful pale has anything happened? I’ll go and call George you look as white as a ghost honey what’s de matter wid you?”” It took Joshua Sowers a good while to control his feelings enough to speak at last he said “no aunt Sally there is nothing the matter with me go and call george. where is miss mary and mattie? I have got a little head-ache” “dey’s up stairs honey” said aunt Sally “now I’ll call dat good-for-nothin’ george I spect he is in de haymow asleep” said she and she started towards the Barn She went in and looked all around for george finally she called out\n\n\n[PAGE 28: SC0313_Ms_030]\n\n\n“You george come down out of dat haymow I hear you snorin’ come down I say or shall I come up dere after you? marse Joshua wants you too come down you lazy trifling free niggah” She was in the act of going up ^(ladder) the[h] when george laid his hand on her shoulder he had heard her calling him and he ran from the house to the Barn and as she was standing in the door he listened at her as long as he wanted to and then slapped his hand on her shoulder. “Why aunt Sally” said george “you had no Idea I was up stairs when mr. sowers came up I heard you telling him I was off some where asleep”\n\n\nGeorge had learned to read and write and he always spoke very fluently and it always made aunt Sally mad to hear him speak as proper as the “white folk” so She said angrily:\n\n\n“Take your hand off a’me free niggah keep your hand off a’me I say if you do speak a little conflurenly conflurently I’ll take none of your inpertinence. dat’s a proper word I’ll bet you”.\n\n\n“Oh aunt Sally dont be so hard on the free negroes” said george good humoredly\n“we cant help being free” Shortly after this they\n\n\n[PAGE 29: SC0313_Ms_031]\n\n\nwent to the house and george went up stairs again he was a great favorite of mrs Sowers she was a full New Englander and she didn’t approve of slavers but her husband would buy Jack and aunt Sally we omitted saying in our last chapter that Mrs Sowers took notice of her husband looking so pale however according to the old proverb it is not too late “while there is life there is hope” and as mr. Sowers entered he tried to look calm but his trials was too thin[i] Dear Reader too thin. his wife notice the deathly pallor of his face as soon as he was seated\n\n\n“Why my Dear how awful pale you look!” Exclaimed mrs Sowers anxiously “Is anything the matter? love” now mrs Sowers was not her husband’s first love he had always treated her well but he had very little love for her he said in a trembling voice “I am a little sick mattie bring me some cool water in a basin and bathe my head a little wont you?”\n\n\n“Of course I will dear father I will do anything I can for you” mattie said as she\n\n\n[PAGE 30: SC0313_Ms_032]\n\n\nhastened to comply with his request she soon returned followed by george but mr sowers could hold out no longer he had had so much excitement during that eventful day – monday second of april – that when the reaction came (Though he seemed to have an iron constitution and a nerve to be envied) the reaction proved too much for him just as Mattie opened the door he fell forward with a groan george and Mattie laid him on the sofa and through their exertions he was soon brought back to consciousness. he looked wildly around for awhile and then said in a voice of distress [÷] “why did you bring me back to consciousness? Would that I could – would to God I could relapse into a state of never ending unconsciousness! Would to god I could sink forever into oblivion!” Mattie at hearing this ran forward and threw her arms around his neck and said “Oh! father it is cruel it is as cruel as the grave for you to talk that way” “Well daughter I have nothing to live for” said Sowers gloomily “have I anything to live for? no! alas! I have nothing to live for nothing! nothing oh! God! oh God!\n\n\n[PAGE 31: SC0313_Ms_033]\n\n\nhe controlled his feelings enough in a few minutes to look as calm as ever but there was a gnawing pain at his heart The bell rang for supper and they all went down as they reached the dining room Wilse Reed came in he always treated mr sowers with great respect before anyone but it was his greatest pleasure to torture him with that secret power he held over him when alone. When they were seated at the table mr Sowers asked Wilse if the miller that was to take William Reed’s place had put in an appearance\n “no sir” Wilse said “he has not come yet I hope he’ll be here in the morninging morning”\n“father what did you say the young man’s name was” Mattie inquired “his name is Hugh Walters” Mr Sowers said “and Mattie he is a nice looking gent I assure you, I can call Wilse to prove that cant I Wilse?” and he turned his face to Wilse “yes sir he is a fine looking gent and miss Mattie you had best set your cap for him” answered Wilse They had finished their supper and they arose from the table mr Sowers went out on the Porch\n\n\n[PAGE 32: SC0313_Ms_034]\n\n\nand taking a seat his thoughts ran thus [÷]\n“I have erred greatly in my young days Oh if my wife and dear child knew what a villian I have been all for the love of woman if she had only proved true I would have been a better man but then I was a drunkard after she had promised me her hand I fell in withe[j] this Wilse Reed as he called him Self and he has made me what I am I could not cannot blame her” he arose after sunset and found his wife and daughter in the parlor they went to bed at nine o’clock as we said in the preceding chapter after they had all went to sleep sowers got up and stealthily crept down stairs it was now half past eleven he was was due at the ledge in half an hour’s time he went to his secretary and got out a considerable amount of gold and silver he then closed the secretary and set awhile in his easy chair as he set there in the dim moonlight he thought he saw a shadow darken the window but did’nt take any notice of it at last he arose and started on his very unpleasant errand toward the ledge of rocks\n\n\n[PAGE  33: SC0313_Ms_035]\n\n\nAfter Wilse Reed got his supper he went to see Mrs Barton if Wilse Reed held a secret power over sowers it was not any more binding than the power mrs Barton held over him\n  “Well Jane” said Wilse as he entered mrs Barton’s residence “Well Jane how are you and how have you been? Well I had my fun with old Sowers today working my secret power over him” mrs Barton looked at him for a long time before she spoke and when she did speak dear Readers she said something “Wilson Reed as I choose to call you have you got a secret power over sowers as you always said you had?” Wilse did not answer immediately finally he said “yes Jane I have and if he tries to play any tricks on me I’ll expose him I’ll let the world and Virginian society see what a villian they have been in company with he is a wolf in sheep’s clothing” mrs Barton again eyed him keenly he was a coarse vulgar looking man he looked as if he would not hesitate to do the most heinouse crime\n\n\n[PAGE 34: SC0313_Ms_036]\n\n\n“Wilson Reed mark my words” exclaimed mrs Barton “mark my words I say the day you expose Joshua Sowers I’ll expose you the day Joshua Sowers is exposed you are no longer Wilson Reed but you’ll be carried from here in chains as —” here she called a name whether the name was of any consequence or not it brought Wilson Reed to comprehend how fully he was in mrs Barton’s power he looked as if he was thunderstruck “Jane you would not expose me would you why do you forget you are my —”  his sentence was cut short for this simple reason mrs Barton’s teacups and saucers were flying around his he head in such profusion he had to stop talking to dodge his head to keep the pieces of china out of his eyes “no you vile micreant”– said mrs Barton exasperated with rage “no no no a thousand times no! I recollect it all well enough but I am not what you was going to say I was” there was a silence of a brief duration there Wilse said “Jane I have never told sowers\n\n\n[Page 35: SC0313_Ms_037]\n“where I was that two years I was missing and I never shall but you will not expose me will you?” his words and[k] and looks were so plaintive mrs Barton felt sorry for him \n “Well Wilse I will do just as I said” mrs Barton answered “I will deal withe you as you deal with sowers you must not torture him so Kate said she heard your voice on the road by the ledge but she could not make out the other voice ‘twas so plaintive nor she didnt see neither of you I said to myself then you were were torturing sowers promise me you’ll not do so again” Wilse promised he would not and then departed he went to the mill and stayed until eleven o’clock then to the ledge this mysterious personage that was to meet him at the was his companion in some plot they had a long talk about half past eleven this personage left and Wilse walked about backward and forward under the ledge until he heard footsteps nearing he looked at his watch he could see the hands dimly in the faint moonlight the the hour was exactly\n\n\n[Page 36: SC0313_Ms_038]\n\n\nTwelve nearer and nearer came the footsteps at last he could discern the form of a man about five hundred feet distant he seated himself on a rock to await the coming of his next man while hovering on the top of the ledge was this mysterious personage waiting for money at last mr Sowers reached the ledge\n“Well Josh I see you are on time” said Wilse Reed as Sowers came to where he was standing “Yes Wilse I am here now to business at once” Wilse did as requested taking care not to speak loud enough for his accomplice at the top of the ledge to hear after about a half hour’s talk they seperated or at least they prepared to seperate and as they were saying their parting words they were startled by hearing a loud and deafening scream Sowers started off home and near his house he glanced up through some bushes and he saw a person walking rapidly away\n “Hold on Josh I’ll be hanged if I have got money enough Hold on I say”\n\n\n[Page 37: SC0313_Ms_039]\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\nOn, the morning, of, the second, of, April Ella Armistead arose Early when she awoke her first thought was of William then her thoughts turned to something she had forgotten to tell William She said to herself:\n“Oh! Why did I forget to tell dear Willie that Albert King proposed to me and I refused him why didnt I tell him that Al King had sworn to be an enemy to me always if I didn’t comply with his proposition” She paused for a few minutes and then said in a voice full of anxiety:\n“Let see he made his proposition to me on Wednesday, the Twenty-Eighth of march yes it was Wednesday evening and what were his last words why they were ‘mark my words Ella Armistead if you do not accept my proposition I am your sworn enemy for ever and as for your marrying William Reed if you marry him or promise to marry him I’ll see if a bullet from a mexican rifle can’t find his life’ yes those were his last words and I have’nt told anyone anything about it, I’ll tell mother and father about it this very morning but it is too late for poor william! The train is now carrying him far far away it is too late! too late!”\n\n\n[Page 38: SC0313_Ms_040]\nWith these words she went down the stairs. Their house stood on the side of a hill near the Opequon Creek. her father owned a large lot of cows horses hogs and sheep. She was a very smart girl She never hesitated to do anything she could to help her mother She accordingly went out and helped to milk the cows This done she helped to get Breakfast Then she rang the bell when Breakfast was ready. She had a brother a very nice looking young man, and a brother-like companion to Hugh Walters. The young miller we spoke of in the preceding chapter. They always greeted one another cordially every morning so as Herbert Armistead came in for such was Ella’s Brother’s name when he came in he said gaily:\n“Good-morning Ella dear how are you?” She said;\n“Pleasant morning to you Brother Bertie How are you? I am not feeling very well this morning I hope you are well” “Bertie” was Herbert’s pet name he said good humoredly with a smile:\n“Oh I am always well sister and I know what is the matter with you, you are grieving about about your dear Willie did he propose before he left? he ought to have done so if he didn’t he is certainly a nice young gentleman”\n\n\n[Page 39: SC0313_Ms_041]\n\n\n“yes William did propose and I accepted him” said Ella blushing until her lips and cheeks were like roses “Sensible girl!” Bertie said approvingly\n“Ella I always thought you were a sensible girl” further conversation was interrupted by father and another Armistead entering They all seated themselves at the table and in the course of the conversation Ella spoke that which was nearest her heart:\nShe began and related all the circumstances of the case about Al King and his last words a copy of which The Reader has already seen.\n“Why didn’t you tell us before this Ella” Herbert said reproachfully and then he added[÷]\n“I would give him the most genteel thrashing he ever had I will do it yet if I ever see him. Hugh Walters is up there with him now. I’ll go up there tomorrow if I have time”\n“Now Herbert don’t be so hasty” Mr. Armistead said reprovingly “Albert King is more of a gentleman than to carry out such threats” Herbert didn’t say no more but as the old proverb says still water runs deep so did Herbert Armistead’s thoughts\n\n\n[Page 40: SC0313_Ms_042]\n\n\nas soon as they had satisfied their appetites They arose from the Table Mr. Armistead and his son went out to the Barn and the women went to cleaning the house up. Ella went up stairs to make the beds She was very sad she commenced talking to herself about her betrothed. She said:\n“Oh how bad I feel since willie has gone he said he would not write until he got ready to come home and he said something about his right name I always thought he was Wilse Reed’s son only he was so unlike him dear willie was all that is noble and pure while Wilse Reed is a coarse villanous looking man” after a silence of about half an hour’s duration she said:\n“yes for the first time in all my life I have began to doubt whether Wilse Reed is willie’s father or not if he is where is his wife willie said from the first he could recollect he was left by Wilse Reed or then he was called by some other name he was left with a woman which he dimly recollects looked something like Mrs. Barton and he says he recollects that Wilse told this woman that he was Wilse’s first wife’s child and he [Page torn; content missing] to Berryville and had almost forgotten where\n\n\n[Page 41: SC0313_Ms_043]\n\n\nhe lived when he was left with this woman”\nElla busied herself with these perplexing thoughts for a good while finally she went down stairs and her mother said “why Ella you look as if you were lost since William has gone away”\n\n\n“Yes mother I do feel like I am lost I know one thing I have lost an opportunity of telling dear willie to watch out for his enemy Al King” her mother looked at her for awhile and then said: “why Ella do you believe Al King meant what he said?” Ella didn’t answer immediately when she did answer she said:\n\n\n“No mother I do not believe Al King meant what he said I simply know he meant it”\n“well.” her mother said anxiously. “hope for the best. I hope he will think more of himself than to harm you or William” but hoping didn’t satisfy Ella it seemed as if new troubles were twining themselves around the fair heroine’s young life She had parted from her lover her betrothed and she had small chances of ever seeing him again if Al King carried out his threats\n\n\n[Page 42: SC0313_Ms_044]\n\n\nShe went up to her room again and knelt and prayed for the safety of her betrothed a fearful presentiment that they would never meet again kept looming up before her She tried to be cheerful to sing but all was of no avail whatever. She was restless. She went down to the creek under the large weeping willow where they had parted oh how she longed to be clasped to that manly heart once more how she longed to see that smiling face once more how she longed to hear that gentle voice again but alas it was gone the manly heart the smiling face the gentle voice was gone gone perhaps forever perhaps for one year perhaps for a shorter period and from the way circumstances stood perhaps yes more than likely they would never meet again oh what harrowing thoughts what terrible anxiety for one so young she sat down and wept tears of bitter sorrow.\n\n\n“Oh William” / [unsure if this is intentional symbol placement?possible ! ][l] She exclaimed “Oh William if you only knew. if you only knew how wretched I am you would never go and leave me!”\nHerbert was working near there and hearing\n\n\n[Page 43: SC0313_Ms_045]\n\n\nthis exclamation he hastened to her side[÷]\n“Why Ella” said Herbert “Ella what is the matter?” Ella did not answer only with sobs after awhile Herbert said “I know what it is Ella and if you or William Reed has one hair your heads harmed I will be revenged or more proper I’ll be avenged” They stayed there and talked a long while finally Herbert went to his work and Ella went to the house bearing as calm a face as she could under the circumstances. Mr. John Armistead had amassed a considerable fortune by saving all his gains and he had got a notion of moving to Washington City he thought it would suit him better. The “Pine hills” was too solitary a place for him as he had formerly lived in Springfield Massachusetts so he had determined to move to Washington. and it was now near midday as Ella reached the house she went to helping her mother to get dinner when dinner was ready she had to blow the horn for the men. The men soon appeared and they were all soon seated at the table to enjoy the delicious repast Mr. Armistead began talking about his plans of moving to Washington and commencing business in a good locality.\n\n\n[Page 44: SC0313_Ms_046]\n\n\n“Well I have decided to go to Washington to start business” said he in the course of the conversation “Herbert I know you would rather be clerk in my store than to work on a farm would you not my son?” and Mr. Armistead looked smilingly at his son he always idolized his son and daughter because they were so very dutiful nothing will make a child so very dutiful as an innocent kind-hearted father and such a father was Mr. Armistead he had always encouraged his children in everything and very sublime were the thoughts of the man who said that “a good man is the noblest work of God” he might have added that a good woman is as noble a work of god as a good man\n“Yes father I would” Herbert said “although I have never murmured I do not like working on a farm how soon do you think you’ll go? not before autumn?” although Herbert didn’t like farming he didn’t like the idea of leaving what he had planted for others to reap “No son” Mr. Armistead said “I guess I’ll not go before autumn” ah! how little did he think that he was to destined to see Something enacted that would make his blood curdle in his veins before he left Virginia but such was the case he was destined to see a revengeful man and an avenging woman exposed to\n\n\n [Page 45: SC0313_Ms_047]\n\n\nthe world he hadn’t the power to look into the future.\n“Well father” said Ella “I am glad to hear you say you are going to stay until fall for perhaps dear Willie will get back by that-time.” “oh your ‘dear Willie’ is all you can think about” said her father playfully. When they had finished their dinner they all went to their work the men to the field the women to their household duties while they are all at their duties we will embrace this opportunity of describing the father and mother of the house. Mr. Armistead. was about forty years of age his hair was as black as night not a gray hair had made its appearance on his head so contented had his life been so free from trouble he had lived that he was as robust as a boy of sixteen he always wore a heavy mustache but no more on his face he was said to be the most friendly honest and upright man in Frederick at that time although he always disapproved of slavery he never argued with any one upon such a subject but lived at peace with all Thus he was termed one of the best “New Englanders” that ever lived in Virginia any stranger would be as frank with him as if they had known him\n\n\n[Page 46: SC0313_Ms_048]\n\n\never so long. his wife was equal to him in all of her characteristics she was at least three years his junior she had married very young she looked to be a great deal younger than she was. one of her sweet smiles would make the most reserved person talkative. The world and age had dealt gently with her when she had first married her husband was poor –very poor– but by his perseverance and her economy they were now in a fair way for making a fortune She had always let her husband do as he said believing it was all for the best and so it was she was a strict member of the church of god and persevering woman in every respect She had always encouraged –never discouraged– her husband in any of his undertakings in fact she had strictly followed her promise at the altar when they were joined together in holy matrimony she had strictly obeyed the injunction “honor and obey him in all things.” and she intended to do so until death did sever the bands between them the bands were in no way binding to her Ah no it was a pleasure more than a duty for her to ‘honor and obey’ him in all things She was also very fond of her children. her son was her\n\n\n[Page 47: SC0313_Ms_049]\n\n\nIdol and her daughter was part of her own existence just imagine! how could children be otherwise than dutiful with such guardian angels as those two people were that we have described \nOh the bliss of such a life Oh what a heavenly blessing it is to have kind parents. parents who take pride in bringing their children up in the way they ought to go! Those people took heed of the old Proverb which says [÷] “as the sapling is bent the tree is bound to grow” That is the sentiment if not the exact words they took pride in doing right in teaching their children right from wrong [÷] and now to proceed we find Mrs. Armistead seated in her easy chair as she sits there her mind or her thoughts rather go back to the time when she had first loved man when she had been asked the questions which novelists so delight to write ^(about) and then when she had timidly said “yes” was she sorry she had said yes? was she sorry she had chosen John Armistead for her husband –no go and ask the pilgrim on his dying bed if he was sorry he had been a christian all his life!\n\n\n[Page 48: SC0313_Ms_050]\n\n\nwhat would his answer be? it would be “No!”\nTime flies while we are reflecting it was near sundown at the Armistead’s the great day God was slowly sinking below the western hills Mrs. Armistead rose out of her easy chair and went about supper she soon had supper ready and father and son were not long in coming to enjoy the repast [÷] Herbert though a dutiful son he had a strong will So he repeated his intentions at supper\n“I will have plenty time to go up to the mill” said Herbert “so I’ll ‘step’ up there tomorrow”\noh! little did he think what a sight would meet his eyes when he did go So supper passed of[m] time rolled on, nine o’clock came half past nine came and they all went to bed little thinking they were to be aroused before morning it was past midnight before Ella Armistead could go to sleep Some irresistible power kept her awake She was just sinking into a pleasant “dose” when she heard a noise as of a horse galloping up the lane toward the house. The the horse stopped and she heard a hasty knock at the door she called her father and ^(he) arose hastily and went down stairs to the door little thinking of the\n\n\n[Page 49: SC0313_Ms_051]\nChapter V\n\n\nAs that horrible cry echoed through the house of Mr. Sowers it filled them with terror we mean it filled all the inmates of the house with terror all except one that was Mrs. Sowers \nShe was hard of hearing. aunt Sally was the first to be aroused. She waked her husband up. Jack was her husband. and then waked george or at least she called george for he was already awake first she went to Miss Mattie Sowers room and called out “Miss Mattie child what is de matter?” no answer came she went to the bed. Miss Mattie was covered up and laying very still what could it all mean? Then she went to Mrs. Sowers room “missus Mary” Sally said as she paused at the door\n\n\n“Miss Mary what’s de matter honey? is you dead or been kilt unexspectedly?” but no answer came finally she opened the door and walked into the middle of the room “Miss Mary Marse Joshua is you you all dead?” Still no answer so she went to the bed to see if they were all dead She looked at Mrs Sowers and finally she discovered that Mr Sowers was not there Where he could have been?\n\n\n[Page 50: SC0313_Ms_052]\n\n\nwas a mystery she could not solve so she concluded she would not wake Mrs Sowers or Mattie until she had found Mr. Sowers.\n\n\n“George” said she to that individual as she left the room “George Marse Josh aint in bed so let’s hurry up and look for him why dont you go on you good for nothin’ freenigger here is Marse Josh gone and nobody knows whar and you creepin’ along as if you were jist enterin’ de white folks church at Greenwood why dont you walk fast I say” but George’s answer was only one of his quiet smiles [÷]\n\n\n“Papa” said aunt Sally as she reached the kitchen and met Jack “Say Dad I cant begin to think whar Marse Josh is gone” Uncle Jack was too dumbfounded to speak for sometime finally he said “what Marse Josh gone and you two great big overgrown nigger’s standing dere?”\nand uncle Jack looked disgusted here was an ignorant uneducated slave ready to die for his master “why dont you go an’ look for marse Josh?” said Jack indignantly “well stand dere I’ll find marse Josh or die tryin’ You an’ George is jist like dum’ niggers in gen’ral”\n\n\n[Page 51: SC0313_Ms_053]\n\n\nOh nature! how infinitely sublime is nature It was the nature of this ignorant slave to love a man who had treated him so well the man who had bought him and his wife just to keep them from being whipped and treated bad by a hard master. Jack set about hunting for his master with a good will his first proposition was to look the house over they accordingly looked through the kitchen dining room Parlor Sitting room Drawing room and finally they went to the door of his private office and called out for the door was locked They called out “Marse Joshua whar is you! is you dead?” but no answer came from the private office “Old woman and george I will have to break dis door down sartin” said uncle Jack his voice quivering with emotion\n\n\n“No! No! Jack dat’ll never do in de world” said aunt Sally “we will look up stairs an’ den in de garret afore we try to break open de private office you know marse always was very strict about dat office of his’n.”\n\n\n[Page 52: SC0313_Ms_054]\n\n\nher words were practicable so Jack and George acquiesced to her proposition in silence They went again to Miss Mattie’s room she was as still as ever they held the light close to her face saw it was very pale They soon left her room and went to the old lady’s room once more. She also was fast asleep they looked in every room on the second floor then they proceeded to the attic it required some considerable time for them to look over the “garret” as Aunt Sally called it then they came down and george and Jack went out to the barn Jack had his whiskey jug hid in the barn it was near one o’clock So Jack thought it was no harm to take a little it would help him to find his master wouldnt it? of course it would why not? wasn’t whiskey the very thing for him to take to keep his spirits up? yes indeed nothing would do better nothing would be more essential So he must take a drink while george was in another part of the barn. They hunted all over the barn from top to bottom then the corn house then the granary They at last went to\n\n\n[Page 53: SC0313_Ms_055]\n\n\nThe mill as they went along by the ledge it was too dark for them to see two men sitting silently in the shadows They went in the mill called Wilse Reed went in where Wilse’s bed was The bed was empty They went all through the mill no person was to be found there\nThey went in to the office at the mill again looked high and low but saw no one they all got wearied out and set down to rest\n\n\n“Oh where can all of de people be at anyhow?” aunt Sally said as they all seated themselves in the office “Well” george said “I dont know where all the people are but one thing I do know and that is we had better not try to rest our bones in here we had better go to the house and set down in the kitchen to rest” They all took his advice and went to the house [÷]\n“Look aheah” said aunt Sally as they seated themselves in the kitchen “look aheah darkies my belief is dat somebody has carried Marse Josh off and kilt him before dis or he would a been heah by dis time”\n\n\n [Page 54: SC0313_Ms_056]\n\n\n“ah aunt Sally” exclaimed george “your ideas are perfectly absurd if it was’nt for him being missing I would be bo bound to say that you and myself were dreaming the same dream”. aunt Sally looked at him indignantly for some time then she said [÷]\n“You nasty little rascal you how dare you tell me dat how dar you joke when your Marse Joshua is missin’?”\nUncle Jack began to feel the influence of his whiskey so he sat very quiet it was quite one o’clock and as soon as they had rested they went in the hall to Sowers private office \n They were just in the act of breaking open the door when they heard some one open the gate and come up the lawn toward the house after a while they heard the kitchen door open easily and shut then they heard the cautious footsteps of a man walking through the house The person whoever it was walked cautiously to the door of the office aunt Sally and Jack and george crept back and Jack whispered in Sally’s ear:\n“I’ll bet anything that’s marse Josh!”\n\n\n [Page 55: SC0313_Ms_057]\n\n\n        X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X\n\n\nWe must turn our attention to Mrs. Barton for a short while when Wilse Reed left she fell into a train of the most serious reflections It was half past eight o’clock when Wilse Reed left. Kate came in about nine. a young man escorted her home. She soon went home to bed. Their house was only a story and a half ^(high). Kate slept up stairs and her mother slept down stairs.\n “Oh what a fool I was in my young days” said Mrs Barton “what a fool I have been a great many Think Kate is _______” she did not finish the sentence but rose up and prepared for bed but she could not go to sleep. She lay there for along time wide awake. It was very warm for so early in April She got up and hoisted the window and seated herself near it while she is sitting there we will describe her in as few words as possible She was about fifty years of age her hair which had been a beautiful golden color was very much sprinkled with gray She had had a great deal of trouble in her \n\n\n[PAGE 56: SC0313_Ms_058]\n\n\nyoung days and that accounted for her hair being so gray as she sat there her thoughts went back to the time when she was a young girl when she first received the attentions of a young widower She was young and pretty then She was so thoughtless so very innocent — She remembered the twilight evening the evening when she stood on the Porch of her dear mother’s residence in the outskirts of a small town in New England Yes she remembered it only too wh well the evening she had stood on the Porch a young widower pleading with her for an answer to his great question “I love you will you be my wife” yes those were the widower’s words she blushed awhile and then said “yes” She looked back to the time when he led her to the altar when she had vowed to love honor and obey until death severed the tie had she kept her word? – no she had not kept her word what was it that ever induced her to Break her word oh horror! What was it indeed had death – no death had not severed the tie but something\n\n\n[PAGE 57: SC0313_Ms_059]\n\n\nelse Oh horror something else She turned her thoughts in a different channel to the time when she had stood at the death-bed of her father and then at the death-bed of her mother she had lost both of them before she had been married a year troubles had come thick and fast as the old proverb says “misfortunes seldom come alone” it had been misfortune after misfortune as soon as she was married misfortunes were her lot and finally she had found out that her marriage was a misfortune Oh! What harrowing thoughts how she shuddered as she thought of them times of the time when she was young when she got married and then of the time when she lost her husband not in death but by being suspected of _________ Oh it was too dreadful to think of\n        “Oh I am miserable” She murmured “I am miserable oh Mathew Barton when you married me you blighted my happy life you have made my life miserable”\n\n\n[PAGE 58: SC0313_Ms_060]\n\n\n        Who was Matthew Barton? and where was he? Reader? Who was he and where was he? We shall find out Next is what had he done? how had he blighted her life? had he murdered anyone? or had he turned highwayman we shall find all out in the end. it is for us to do. We must. There is no alternative we must unravel the secret of this woman’s life it is nothing more than duty nothing more So we will – I will take an author’s privilege of looking into her former life I will take the privilege of unraveling this woman’s Secret life She had come to Brookland some three years before the opening of our story no one knew who she was nor here she came from anymore than that she came from a New England town some said she had never been married others said she was no respectable woman She bore it all without a word all Mr. Sowers knew about her was that she she paid the rent regular and he always said she was a noble woman. She was a nice housekeeper also and she had taught Kate all she knew\n\n\n[PAGE 59: SC0313_Ms_061]\n\n\nabout housekeeping She had had a lover before [crossed out word] Matthew Barton she had promised to marry him he went of[n] to the far far west and she beleived[o] him dead as she had never heard of him again Would she ever see him again? That question gained place in her mind but it was soon expelled by one not half so pleasant Was her husband dead no no but worse than dead! It was now near twelve o’clock she tried to arouse herself but she could not Those awful reflections was a terrible strain on her nerves She saw a man dressed in miller’s clothing pass along near the house it was an unusual hour for a miller to be out but she thought perhaps it might one of the miller’s[p] from Greenwood mills She did’nt pay much attention to the person in question for her thoughts were elsewhere The night air was getting very cool but she still sat there looking out of the window\n\n\n[PAGE 60: SC0313_Ms_062]\n\n\nShe was beautiful in her old age She had been more beautiful in her young days\n        “I can have no peace until I speak my past history over to I my self Eighteen years ago I married Matthew Barton the widower of Springfield I lived with him happily for a considerable time I also took care of a child a boy he said was his first wife’s child finally he was _______”\n        here was was an instance where the old proverb comes true the old proverb says “man proposes and god disposes” Mrs Barton had made the proposition to tell her own private history Just as [crossed out word] she was going to divulge what her husband had done to sever the ties between them a horrible shriek was heard in the direction of Mr Sower’s residence\nMrs Barton gave a start and reiterated in a scared voice:\n        “Merciful heaven who can it be? Who can it be?”s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n[PAGE 61: SC0313_Ms_063]\n\n\nafter Mr. Sowers left mrs Rebbecca King’s residence She seated herself in the parlor to try to think where her son could have went She could form no definite idea\n        \n“I can’t think” Mrs King said after she had puzzle her Brain for sometime “I cannot think for my life where Albert can be he has no friends he cared about staying with I will ask my boarder Dr. Maltby if he has seem Al., anywhere today I don’t think he can be with any of his friends” so having relieved her mind thus She went out in the kitchen to see about dinner for her “boarder” as she always called and delighted to call Dr. Maltby She said her son had no friends he cared about staying with ah! Poor innocent minded pearents[q] don’t know what an Evil heart their children sometimes have. She thought there\n\n\n[PAGE 62: SC0313_Ms_064]\n        \n        was no young man so guileless as her son. he had always acted in her presence as a perfect gentleman. we will proceed to give a description of her person. She was a slimfaced woman of about forty-five or near about She had dark hair a little sprinkled with gray She was also remarkably tall She had married young to am[r] man named Philip King he had died a good while before the opening of our story he was a hard working honest man and long before he left her a widow he had bought this house on the upper end of Loudon Street and she had lived with ease and comfort in her nice little house for some years She had rented one of her front rooms out to good old Dr Maltby an old bachelor a genial jovial old man and as a doctor his reputation was considered par excellence number one\n\n\n[PAGE 63: SC0313_Ms_065]\nmrs. King would’nt have cared if he would propose but he did’nt seem to be in a hurry well dinner time came and so did Dr Maltby he always wore a pleasant face no one knew of his heart sorrow no one thought he had ever had a heart sorrow but we shall see. He came in humming a favorite tune \n\n\n        “Well Mrs. King How are you today?” said he as he entered the dining room\n\n\n        “I am well thank you how are you?” Said mrs King cordially as she proceeded to pour him a cup of coffee\n        \n“Thanks I am well always well” he said gaily as he took the proffered cup of hot coffee when mrs King passed it to him they eat dinner quietly and as the doctor finished his dinner Mrs. King asked\n“Say doctor have you seen my boy today? Mr Sowers his employer was here today enquiring for him have you seen him?” The doctor studied for sometime before he spoke finally he said as he arose from the \n\n\n[PAGE 64: SC0313_Ms_066]\n\n\nTable “no ma’am” said he “I have not seen him anywhere today Excuse me for being so long in answering your question”\n\n\n        “very excusable doctor you are  very excusable” Said mrs. King flippantly “I know how it must be with you you have so many patients to attend that your mind gets mixed up” The doctor did’nt stay at his office long he had to go to attend some more of his patients Mrs. King’s thoughts soon turned to albert Where could he be? This question came to her for the twentieth time and was as often put away unanswered her mind wandered back to the time when her Albert was small when she could always keep him in sight now he had come home on Sunday and took some of his clothes away and told her a falsehood what was his motive? She finally went up stairs to his room She looked around to see what clothes he had taken She started back aghast when she discovered his trunk was gone who could have taken it? How could his trunk be carried out of the house and\n\n\n[PAGE 65: SC0313_Ms_067]\n\n\nShe know nothing about it? \n\n\n“Oh,” Said she as she sank into a seat “Oh where is my son gone has he deserted me? Or has some one taken advantage of his absence and stole his trunk”\n\n\n        Oh! how a mother loves a child! her child is her very life! She had rather suffer all privations hardships toil and woe and even to meet death for her child there is no love so strong no love so binding as a mother’s love how thankful all those who have a mother ought to be but let us return to the subject [÷]\n\n\n        Mrs. King finally arose and went down stairs She met her servant girl in the hall\n\n\n        “Ann,”Said she as she reached the hall “Ann, Albert’s trunk is gone it must be stolen or has my son ran away and left me Oh Ann if he has I Shall go crazy if he is no seen or heard of today it will dement me I cant stand this suspense”\n\n\n[PAGE 66: SC0313_Ms_068]\n\n\nand the poor woman shed tears profusely as she leaned her head on the breast of her faithful servant ann. Oh the anguish of that mother’s heart then how she would have clasped her dear boy to her breast if he was only with her it takes an iron heart to withstand a mother’s smile a mother’s caress the hard-hearted man will welcome a mother’s Smile the inebriate’s the assassin’s the Thief’s heart will become softened under the influence of a mother’s smile\n\n\n        Ann lead her mistress to the sitting room and brought her the camphor bottle as it was Mrs. King favorite medicine when the doctor was away She composed herself as well as she could to away the coming of the doctor as she sat in her easy chair She again began to wonder where her son was he could easily climb up to his windows the back porch was directly under it but he must have had help he could’nt get his trunk away without help had any of her servants helped him perhaps Dick the errand boy had she would ask him\n\n\n[PAGE 67: SC0313_Ms_069]\n\n\n        “Dick your Marse Alberts trunk is gone how came you to help him carry it away? deny it if you dare and I’ll fairly skin you”\n\n\n        Dick trembled like a leaf but he was like the great and noble Washington he would’nt tell a Lie says Dick to himself [÷] “no I’ll not tell a lie I dont care what She does” then he said in a clear voice “I cant help it mum if you skin me entirely I aint a’goin’ to tell no lie about I know nothin’ about it” Mrs King was exasperated with rage at this impudent answer from a little niggah as She termed him. There was no White servants in Winchester at that time the people who didn’t own Slaves always hired them from their masters or have a free negro bound to them until he or she was twenty-one Dick was bound to her until he was of age he was about fifteen years of age and Mrs King always Said “he had a good many pots of mush to eat before he’d be a man” She looked at him for a considerable time before she spoke She seemed as if she was about to change her mind about skinning Dick for\n\n\n[PAGE 68: SC0313_Ms_070]\n\n\nawhile yet finally She said [÷] \n\n\n        “Well my young man you are certainly very impudent and for two cents I’d give you a genteel whipping” Dick didn’t mind threats so they were not carried out by this time Doctor Maltby had returned he was always very sociable and Mrs. King took it for granted he was making hasty preparations for a proposal woud’nt she accept? now you had better bet she would! as soon as the doctor came he went into the parlor to have a pleasant chat with Mrs. King. her first question was \n\n\n        “Well doctor I see you have got back have you seen Albert yet in your rounds”? \nThe doctor had to study again for a considerable time it seemed as if his mind was more \npreoccupied that day than usual eventually he said\n        “Indeed madam I have not I guess he has got back to the mill ere this I’ll go out there tomorrow and see if he isn’t there if he is’nt there I will make inquiries about him” They seated themselves and she related all the circumstances about the trunk to him at the conclusion he said “Well well that does seem very very strange perhaps he is only playing a joke on you”\n\n\n[PAGE 69: SC0313_Ms_071]\n\n\nhis explanation seemed plausible enough so Mrs. King made no more reference to her son’s absence in the doctor’s presence that evening but she thought it a good time to put in a word of courtship do She began thus[÷] “doctor why dont you get married? you could get a good wife here in Winchester?” her words had at last touched the right cord for the doctor’s muscles twiched nervously as she spoke Ah? She thought she had gained a point but the doctor crushed her high hopes by saying a[s] he rose to  take his leave [÷]\n\n\n        “Mrs. King I beg you never to refer to that subject again I have loved and do love a woman I never expect to see I have looked for her for years and have had no tidings of her yet that and only that has turned my hair so gray I have grown gray in Grief for her I loved so well.” he closed the door hastily as he ceased speaking and went in to his office Strange words very strange words for a man to utter. a man who was always so jovial as doctor Maltby was who he could have loved was more than Mrs King could find out\n\n\n[PAGE 70: SC0313_Ms_072]\n\n\nSo she sat and wondered at his strange words her mind then went Back to the home of her childhood then of the time when she parted with her Brother She had not seen him for a good many years She supposed he had been married ere this Oh if she could only see that dear Brother how happy she would be then came the thought would she ever meet him? was he living or dead? would she know him if she was to see him? Yes she would know her dear brother if she would ever see him of course she would why not? time flies fast and it was soon supper time She went down stairs to order supper she met Dick in the passage and she asked in a stentorious voice  “Dick have you set the table? if you have not you had better do so as quick as you can have you set it?\n\n\n        “Yes ma’am I have set the table” said Dick quietly as he went to attend his other duties Mrs. King proceeded to the kitchen to see what Ann was doing toward getting supper She found Ann very busy, Ann was a free girl too and was hired from her parents by Mrs. King She was a very smart girl and george Munro the boy that lived with Mr. Sowers was very much attached to her and she to him \n\n\n[ Newman's original page #'s go from PAGE 70 to PAGE 73 indicating that pages 71 and 72 are missing from the manuscript ][s]\nChapter VII\n        [PAGE 73: SC0313_Ms_073]\n\n\nThe words recorded in the latter clause of the Third chapter were slowly uttered by Wilse Reed. Mr Sowers stopped still. he had no idea Wilse was following. as he turned his head in the direction from which Wilse Reed’s voice proceeded he said in a trembling voice [÷] “Oh Wilse Oh Wilse have you no heart? dont you know mercy? didn’t you hear that unearthly shriek coming from the direction of my house how much money do you want for heaven’s sake dont keep me here if you have any heart at all”\n Wilse looked at him for some time before he spoke then he said peremptorily [÷]\n        \n\n\n“I can answer all of your questions better when we are seated under the ledge to come on Sowers come on I say” Sowers saw it was no use to argue the case for argument was no go with a desperate man like Wilse Reed they went back to the ledge and after they were seated Wilse Reed said in a low voice :\n\n\n“Now Josh I’ll answer your questions. in the first place I lost my heart when I first entered into that fiendish plot of yours in the\n\n\n[PAGE 74: SC0313_Ms_074]\n\n\n        “second place I dont know mercy or I should have exposed you and done justice to ___ well you know who. in the third place I did hear that unearthly shriek but what is that to me? I dont care who it is or if the[t] die before you reach the house do you hear that? in the fourth place you asked me how much money I wanted well you gave me one hundred dollars I want another hundred and that quick too so out with it”\n\n\n        Sowers could say nothing but pull out his purse and in the dim moonlight count out one hundred dolla dollars this done he handed it to Wilse who grabbed it eagerly. Sowers looked ghastly pale as he sat there he was doing this for revenge or at least he had done this something years ago for revenge now he was reaping the bitter fruits of his revenge who was the most avenged him or his adversary?\n The great one who had said “vengeance is mine” had not changed his laws therefore those who do an evil deed for revenge or compensation for an evil deed that has been done to them they must be avenged the most in the end so it was with Sowers What he had done was to avenge an innocent person whom he said proved untrue\n\n\n[PAGE 75: SC0313_Ms_075]\n\n\nWilse was silent for some time then he said :\n        “Well Mr Sowers you had as well go now as we have concluded our little business Good-night”\n [Crossed out letter] Mr Sowers was about to rise to go when he heard some person or persons coming down the road he and Wilse quickly ensconced them selves in the Shadow of the ledge presenly[u] the persons went pass[v] the ledge talking cautiously. Sowers recognized their voices to be that of Jack. George. and aunt sally he was going to ask them where they were going but Wilse interposed\n\n\n        “Why Wilse perhaps they have killed their mistresses” said sowers anxiously “and they may be running away to escape the punishment of the law let me go after them Wilse”\n and Sowers looked pleadingly in Wilse Reed’s face but as Wilse Reed’s face was as calm and imperturbable as ever\n        “no Josh I say no and when I say no I mean no, you have escaped the punishment of the law for a long time. it is no small thing for a man to rob the ______” he didn’t finish his\n\n\n[Pages 76-82 missing]\n\n\n[PAGE 83: SC0313_Ms_076]\nmoney – wanted to be paid well for his work\n        “Well Wilse you said awhile ago you wod would Peach[w] if I doubted your word now I defy you you want my money to help you carry out your threats since I’ve heard that I’ll not give you one cent either to defray your expenses or anything else do you hear that?”\n\n\nWilse didn’t answer immediately but his thoughts were — \n“Oh if I were not bound – if I was only free I would bring him down so low his dogs wouldn’t make friends with him but alas! alas! I am bound by fetters She has me in her power I’ll do something desperate to what I’ll get out of her power” he paused awhile and then said “Well Sowers I’ll not hunt up those parties but I’ll scandalize you and yours so that no one will notice you”\n\n\nWilse Reed’s last words nettled Mr Sowers he rose from his chair and said his voice stern\n“Wilson Reed I order you to leave my house forever you low lifed scoundrel I wish I had never given you the money I gave you tonight you dirty villainous scoundrel[!][x]”\n\n\n[Page 84 missing]\n\n\n        \n[PAGE 85: SC0313_Ms_077]\nChapter VIII\n        Midnight had long since passed and ^(in) a few brief hours daybreak would come. Still nothing had occurred to break the peaceful stillness of the two ladies rooms namely [÷] Mrs and Miss Sowers’ rooms and as Jack ceased Speaking Mr Sowers proceeded to light a candle after he had lit the candle Jack advanced toward him he looked his master in the face for some time at last he said anxiously [÷]\n\n\n        “Oh marse! You look as pale as a ghost What is de matter wid you? You tremble like a leaf has you bin hurt?” Sowers did not Speak immediately presently he said unconcernedly [÷] “Oh nothing the matter with me Jack. Let us see who it was that Screamed so loud come on” he knew his orders would be obeyed so he hastily proceeded to his wife’s room he aroused her and said [÷[y]]\n\n\nMary was it you that screamed so loud a while ago?”She didn’t seem to understand him presently she said: “no dear I dont know anything about any Ice cream you must have been dreaming” and thinking she had solved the mystery she closed her eyes and fixed herself in an an easy attitude for going to Sleep again but she was aroused again by aunt Sally coming up to the bed and saying\n\n\n        “Come missus raise up you didn’t understan’marse Joshua\n\n\n[PAGE 86: SC0313_Ms_078]\n\n\n        “he said he heard somebody hollerin’ an’ he wants to know if it was you or not. was it you missus?”\n\n\n        “Oh I understand you now” said she interestedly [÷] “no it wasn’t me have you been to Mattie’s room?”\n\n\n        “Yes missus we’s been dere all ov us cullud folke but She was a’sleepin’ quietly” said aunt sally [÷]\n        \n        “Well it’s no use standing here” said Sowers [÷] “We had better go to Mattie’s room again and see what is the matter” so saying he repaired[z][aa] to miss Sowers’ room he went close up to her bed and looked at her for some time She looked very pale he listened was she breathing? Yes but very faintly he put his hand on her breast did her heart beat? Yes but very slowly his hand was of course out side of the cover but if her heart was beating fast he would know it So he raised the cover so as to feel heart her heart’s pulsation better he looked could he believe his eyes? Yes he was forced to beleive[ab] [÷] well what did he see? Why he saw her pure white bosom bared and on the left breast nearest the heart was a little was a red spot was he dreaming? No he was wide awake he was holding the cover in his hand he let it drop and beheld his hand was stained with blood it proved to be too much for his overtaxed nerves and he staggered reeled and fell Jack caught him and laid him on a sofa that was in the room —\n\n\n[PAGE 87: SC0313_Ms_079]\n\n\nhe was soon brought to consciousness by the unrelating[ac][ad] efforts of his faithful servant –Jack– as soon as he was able to get up he said [÷] “Oh Jack I believe my poor child is dead—murdered— Oh God!”\n\n\nHe walked to the bed again was it so could it possibly be so? Yes it was possible he knelt down beside his daughter’s bed and began pleading wildly imploringly [÷]\n\n\n        “Oh daughter! Oh my dear dear child do not die –live! For my sake live” he broke down with sobs finally he rose and said [÷] “I must send for the doctor and a kind nurse perhaps her life may yet be spared— Jack go immediately for Dr. Maltby– George you get log Logan as he is a fast horse– and ride for life over to Mr Armstead’s get his daughter to come over with you –Aunt Sally you go down to Mrs. Barton’s and ask her please to come up here. I will write a note to Doctor Maltby and one to Mr Armstead’s daughter be in a hurry no please do all of you” by the time he ceased speaking aunt Sally was half way to Mrs Barton’s Jack was soon of to Winchester for Dr. Maltby— George was soon riding swiftly across feilds[ae] and meadows toward Mr Armistead’s residence it was he that rode up to Mr Armistead’s door and knocked as previously alluded to\n\n\n[PAGE 88: SC0313_Ms_080]\n\n\nWhen Sowers was left alone he went again to look at his daughter –must he call his wife? yes– no— he thought he had better not call her until the doctor arrived and restored his daughter to consciousness– So he knelt by the bed –perhaps the death-bed of his child and for the first time in the long years of his maturity he prayed prayed earnestly pleadingly he begged the ruler of the great universe to spare his child he implored the great King of High heaven to Spare his only child his very life Oh how great is the works of a kind providence was his daughter stricken down perhaps to death to bring the haughty mill owner on his knees to his Maker? perhaps it was however as he knelt he cried out in the anguish of his sorrow-stricken heart “Oh God spare my child spare my darling child she is my only child Oh Spare her life!” he rose and seated himself on the edge of the bed and gazed long and earnestly on the face of his child not a muscle of her face moved could she be saved? he hoped so he hoped she would live his only hope for future happiness was in his daughter’s recovery at last he heard some one coming in the yard he composed himself as well as possible presently the door was opened and mrs Barton walked in. aunt sally following close behind— Mrs. Barton went to Mattie’s bed and looked at the little red spot on her breast\n+        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +\n\n\n[PAGE 89: SC0313_Ms_081]\n\n\n        When Dr. Maltby recognized his visitor he said “Why Jack what brings you here this time of night is anyone sick at your house?” Jack pulled the note out of his pocket and as he handed it to the doctor he said “Oh marse docter miss mattie’s bin stabbed right in de heart I’se feard She’s kill” The doctor tore the envelope open and hastily perused the note it ran breifly as follows [÷] “Please come to my house immediately Jack will tell you all dont delay.” “Joshua. Sowers.” The doctor called Dick to get his horse– Dick promptly obeyed and the doctor accompanied by Jack was soon on his way to Brookland they soon arrived there and the doctor immediately went up to Miss Mattie’s room he found Mr Sowers and aunt Sally There he examined the wound and then gave her a powerful stimulant presently mrs. Barton came in and as the door opened the doctor turned his head to see who it was he started and clutched the coverlet nervously however he soon recovered himself Why did he start at the presence of this woman? The question Shall remain unanswered for some time yet “doctor do you think she will live?” Mr Sowers asked— “if she dies my only hope for happiness in this world is gone”\n\n\n[PAGE 90: SC0313_Ms_082]\n\n\n        The doctor waited for some time before he ventured an assertion then he said “well I cant tell yet she may get over it as the stab is not very deep but it will be a long time before she will cease to be an invalid” by this time Mattie began to show some sign of returning consciousness Mrs Sowers was called by aunt Sally[÷]\n\n\n        “Missus” said aunt Sally “missus wake up dont you know your darter is bin almost kilt? mrs. Sowers just dreamily heard what aunt Sally said and she faintly murmured [÷] “Yes aunt Sally— you may put more water in the kettle” aunt Sally looked at her in astonishment:\n\n\n        “Oh missus de doctor has come and dey wants you to come in to miss mattie’s room right away” aunt Sally said “The doctor here and want me to come in mattie’s room why what’s the matter in there aunt Sally?” mrs. Sowers was fully aroused by this time and she rose hastily and went to her daughter’s room She glanced at her daughter’s breast and saw the blood slowly oozing out it did not overcome her for she had nerves of iron it seemed\n“doctor is she dead?” mrs. Sowers asked in a low voice\n\n\n        “No madam She is not dead but unless my directions followed to the minute I am afraid there is little hope– yet I think with a little care or at least by being punctual in giving her her medicine \n\n\n[PAGE 91: SC0313_Ms_083]\n\n\n“She may live. However, I’ll hope, for the best.” There was a silence of brief duration then it was broken by mr Sowers as he looked at his watch\n        \n        “Why it is two o’clock— yes near three” said he “I guess george will soon be here with Miss Ella.” The doctor still sat by his patient presently he said “Mrs. King is very anxious  and very much annoyed at her son’s absence I suppose he has come before now and made all necessary explanations”\n\n\n        “No indeed he has not been seen or heard of” mr Sowers said. Mattie Sowers opened her eyes at last she looked wildly around put her hand to her breast and cried out— “Oh he has stabbed me! he has stabbed me!” and she sank again into unconsciousness the doctor Smiled and said “She will soon regain her mind” Mr Sowers was glad to see the doctor smile for he knew then that there was some hope [÷]\n\n\n        “Well I cant help thinking of Albert’s absence” the doctor said softly “his mother will fairly go mad if he is not heard of soon I hop[af] he will soon make his appearance” then he added “mr Sowers I suppose your new miller has got here ere this”\n\n\n\n\n[PAGE 92: SC0313_Ms_084]\n\n\n        “No sir he has not come yet but I hope he will come tomorrow” Said mrs. [ag][ah]Sowers in a voice scarcely audible.

The question must necessarily remain unanswered for Mattie is again returning to consciousness the doctor asked her what was the matter “miss sowers” said he kindly “what is the matter? do you know who stabbed you?”The word ‘no’ came faintly from her lips very faintly but it was enough to convince The doctor that his medicine had\n\n\n[PAGE 93: SC0313_Ms_085]\n\n\ndone as well as he hoped [÷]\n\n\n        The Speaking aroused mr Sowers he immediately asked how his daughter was the doctor answered\n\n\n        “She is much better.

No he could not have ever heard it. Mattie stirred again She opened her eyes and stared around for some time then she asked in a hollow voice “isn’t this doctor Maltby?” “yes miss that is my name”the doctor said promptly Mattie was fully aroused now and she asked in a little stronger voice. “Where is mother and father doctor?” “they are here” said the doctor soothingly.\n\n\n[PAGE 94: SC0313_Ms_086]\n        \n        The mother and father were very anxious to talk with her but the doctor took them both aside and whispered those words in their ears. \n\n\n        “dont allude to the stabbing until I say you may” they promised they would not and then went to their daughter’s bedside She smiled faintly as she saw her mother coming a silent kiss was all the mother could give it was now precisely three o’clock the doctor still sat beside the bed. We have made previous allusion to the fact that the doctor was one of the best of his profession mrs and mr sowers and mrs Barton all looked kindly on the doctor’s patient. \n\n\n“Mattie soon sank into a profound slumber her mind was at rest after awhile mr Sowers ventured to ask “do you think she will be well in a few days doctor?” The doctor felt the pulse and forehead then he said “no sir I will not say she will be well in a few days you will find it will take a good while for her to get well She may have the typhoid fever from this scare”\n\n\nmr sowers still clung to a hope for the best hadn’t he the great miller knelt and prayed for his daughter’s life to be spared? of course he had\n\n\n+        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +        +\n\n\n[PAGE 95: SC0313_Ms_087]\n\n\nas Mr Armstead opened his door he was accosted by george as follows  [÷] “Good evening mr Armstead I am sorry to arouse you up but some unprincipled Scoundrel has stabbed miss mattie”\n\n\n        “Why How are you george?” mr Armstead said I can hardly beleive[ai] you.” George pulled the note out of his pocket and handed it to mr Armstead saying “that is for miss Ella to come over to mr Sowers as quick as possible” Ella heard him and she was there with a light as quick as a flash She tore the envelope of[aj] and unfolding the note read as follows  [÷]         “Miss Ella Armstead please come to my house as quick as possible come with george \nJoshua Sowers”\nElla got ready as soon as she could and started off with george they soon arrived at mr Sower’s house it was ten minutes after three o’clock when she and George reached the house She went right up stairs immediately :[ak][al]\n\n\n        “Good evening friends” She said in a low voice I have got here at last”\n\n\n        “Good morning miss” said Dr Maltby\n\n\n[PAGE 96: SC0313_Ms_088]\n\n\n        “it is very near morning” the others greeted her cordially “how is dear mattie?” She asked presently “has she come to consciousness yet?”\n\n\n        “Yes she has and now she is sleeping quietly” the doctor said. after a few moments silence Ella said: “your boy george told me that Albert King had left or dissapeared very mysteriously”\n\n\n        “Yes he has certainly disappeared” mr Sowers Said and then mrs Barton said in a voice that sounded musical to Dr. Maltby— “I saw a man dressed in a miller’s shirt coming up this way about an hour before I heard the scream” Sower then recollected his experience and what he saw— Says he– “I saw a man dressed in millers’ clothes walking rapidly away I did not come to the house right away as I had some books to look over” in a few moments the doctor ventured to ask– “who do you think could have done this dastardly deed?”\n\n\n        There was a silence for some time it was broken by Ella– She said emphatically. \n\n\n        “Albert King!”\n\n\n        Her words had great force so the guilt was set on Al King and so we leave our characters until morning\nChapter IX\n\n\n[PAGE 97: SC0313_Ms_089]\n\n\n        The eventful night had passed. and the great Day God was slowly but surely making his appearance in the Oriental horizon. it proved a bright sunny day. but was there Sunshine in all of our characters hearts? –no.

I hope you will not leave or say anything about our [Page torn; content missing] it will kill Mattie to hear of her\n\n\n[PAGE 98: SC0313_Ms_90]\n\n\n“father’s mean plotting. you wont say anything about will you Wilse?” Wilse studied awhile and then said huskily [÷] “I don’t know when a man defies another to do their worst I think it is time to tell all one knows” Sowers began to feel scared for fear Wilse would tell so he said with a sickly smile\n        “Well Wilse give me your answer when you get your breakfast wont you?”\n\n\n“Yes I will” said Wilse tartly and Sowers went slowly toward his house he met his new miller at the diningroom door. “Why how are you Hugh?” said Mr Sowers kindly — “Good morning Mr Sowers” Hugh said with a bow — “I am well thank you I couldn’t get of[an] from home yesterday I hope you’ll excuse me for not coming.”\n\n\n        “Oh very excusable Hugh very excusable” They took seats on the porch and began talking matters over “I am really sorry to hear your daughter has been seriously wounded by some unknown person” Hugh said in the course of the conversation.\n\n\n        “from all accounts it was not an unknown person” said Mr Sowers as soon as Hugh Walters ceased speaking. he added after a moments pause “Albert King is suspected. as he has disappeared\n\n\n[PAGE 99: SC0313_Ms_091]\n\n\n“So mysteriously and Just at this particular time”\n Hugh was bewildered. he did not know that Al. King was missing. he was interested at once so he asked\n        “Isn’t Albert at the mill?”\n        \n“no he has not been seen or heard of since Sunday”\nMr Sowers said and further conversation was [Crossed out word] cut short by aunt Sally announcing breakfast.\nWhen Hugh went into the dining-room he was warmly greeted by Ella and Mrs Sowers.\n        \n“Why miss Ella” said he “how have you been enjoying yourself since Willie went away?”\n        \n“You are speaking in a jesting way” said Ella seriously “but to tell the truth I cant enjoy myself while he is away and Al King at large” Hugh laughed and said [÷] “Why you must think Albert is dangerous he always acted like a gentleman with me” Ella did not speak for some time — finally she said “It is more than I can say about him he acted very mean with me not long since”\n\n\nThey had finished their breakfast and they rose from the table Mr Sowers walked down to the gate and as Wilse came out he asked in a low voice — \n\n\n[PAGE 100: SC0313_Ms_092]\n\n\n“Wilse what is your decision”[÷] Wilse did not stop but said in a voice equally low — \n        “I will not say anything about it”\n\n\n        While this was going on Hugh was having a pleasant chat with Ella. Hugh Walters was one of those m men who had never had cupid’s arrow plunged in his heart. he liked to talk with a young Lady but as for love he called that nonsense.\n\n\n        Will he be an old bachelor? That question will answered[ao] in the Course of time. god has not left it for man to look into the future.\n        \n“Well good-day Ella until I see you again”\nHugh said as he started off toward the mill.\n as soon as Mr Sowers had given Hugh his full lessons about the mill he set off for Winchester to see if he could find a person Sharp enough for a detective. he thought it useless to try so he telegraphed to New York for a detective. before noon he received a reply it ran as follows [÷]\n                                        “Will send one immediately.”    “[ap]\n                                                        “A.

The doctor rode out with him.\n\n\n[PAGE 101: SC0313_Ms_093]\n\n\n        “I am so glad I met with such immediate success” Sowers said gleefully — ah little did he know how completely he had o put himself in a man’s power a man that had been hunting him for years — had been hunting ever since that night him and Wilse went out to the _____ we cannot finish that sentence the pen refuses to quote the words to finish that sentence yes he had put himself fully in a certain man’s power. Who was this man? Was he a detective?\n  What did he want with the great Virginia mill owner would he find Wilse? Would he know him?\n\n\n        Those are all questions and we are resolved to find answers in the course of time. answers to all of them.\n\n\n        Sowers and Dr Maltby soon reached the formers former’s residence. the doctor went up to see his patient immediately while he is making an examination allow me to premise that Dr Maltby did not leave Mr Sowers residence on that eventful night — until near four o’clock therefore he had, had little rest — very — little — well what is he got to say about his patient?\n\n\n        “She cannot escape the typhoid fever” says he in answer to one of Ella’s anxious enquiries\n\n\n[PAGE 102: SC0313_Ms_094]\n\n\n        “Oh I am so sorry” Exclaimed the kind hearted girl “I am so sorry so very sorry for poor dear Mattie. Ah Mattie speak to me do please”\n\n\n        There was no answer only a vacant stare — only an idiotic whimper from kind hearted Mattie Sowers She had lost her mind — she knew nothing.\n\n\nAh the bitter pangs of that mother’s heart! as She sat at the bedside of her only child. She did not say much but her thoughts were —\n\n\n “Ah! that I could suffer for thee my child!” Mrs Sowers was a meek uncomplaining woman She had borne life’s troubles quietly.\n\n\n        Yes without a murmur — now here was a new trouble — her dear daughter an only child suffering and would perhaps die\n\n\n        her reverie was interrupted by Mr Sowers entering. he asked anxiously “doctor how is she? any better?” the doctor replied in the negative then Sowers said “do you think she will be strong enough to carry her through this fever”\n\n\n        “yes” the doctor said “yes I think her constitutution[ar] is strong enough it will be hard for her though.”\n\n\n[PAGE 103: SC0313_Ms_095]\n\n\n        Soon after this the doctor took his leave before he left — Sowers told him not to say anything about the Detective — Shortly after the doctor left Kate came up to see Mattie. She expressed her ‘heartfelt’ sorrow in this wise [÷] “Oh poor thing I wonder who could have the heart to harm one hair of her head”\n\n\n        “Kate dont talk so loud” said Ella sternly but in a low voice “It will be worse than stabbing her if you kill her by your harangue”\n\n\nKate did not care for what Ella said for as previously mentioned she didn’t take insults.\nShe talked a great deal about the wickedness of the world and she said in conclusion [÷]\n        “Indeed I think the world will not stand long if people dont get better”\n\n\nafter this She went down in the kitchen and as she said “to have a pleasant chat with aunt Sally” When she entered the kitchen aunt Sally was singing one of her peculiar hymns the words ran thus:         “Oh de church was built an’ de aingile mourn\n        “King Jesus laid de corner stone”\n                “Oh my Jesus he died on de tree”\n\n\n[PAGE 104: SC0313_Ms_096]\n\n\n        George came in about this time and he remarked “Dont cry any more aunt Sally your mother is better I hope” aunt Sally grew indignant at this and started George off in a hurry [÷]\n\n\n        “George is so impudent” Kate said to aunt Sally Sympathetically but aunt Sally grew more indignant than ever she gave Kate a “black’ look and said “now Kate haint I done gone an’ tole you yistiddy dat we dem dont want you here?”\n\n\n        “I know you said so but I hope you dont mean it” Kate said smiling faintly.\n\n\n        “yes I does mean it” said aunt sally sternly and Kate took leave at once.\n\n\n        We now find Mr Sowers in the haymow talking to Wilse. he kept nothing from Wilse so he told Wilse about the coming of a Detective Wilse paled a little at hearing this.\n\n\n        “Now Wilse I dont want you to tell anyone about this detective or let him know that you know he is a detective” Sowers said this as he was about to go to his house. as soon as he left, Wilse began talking to himself\n\n\n        “if they catch my fellow I am done for confound the detective! he may come fooling around me if\n\n\n[PAGE 105: SC0313_Ms_097]\n\n\n“he does I will put a knife in his heart” after a short pause he added “if I was only out of Jane Barton’s power I might close business and leave before the detective comes. I must be on my guard for if he should call me by any other name than Wilse if he does I must not answer” his reverie was stopped by Herbert Armstead riding to the yard to fasten his horse as soon as Herbert had secured his horse he went to Mr Sowers’ house. he found Ella in the dining room alone.\n\n\n        “How do you find yourself Ella and Ho how is miss Mattie?” Herbert said this as he entered the room\n\n\n        “I am well Bertie. but poor Mattie is very low Oh Bertie you know how I loved her you can Sympathize with me. cant you?”\n\n\n        “Yes indeed dear sister I can Sympathize with you, said Herbert warmly he added after a pause “who could have done this have you formed any theory”\n\n\n“Yes we have formed a theory. Al. King is suspected as he has not been seen since Sunday”\n\n\nHerbert looked surprized. “What!” says he “Al. King aint gone?”\n\n\n[PAGE 106: SC0313_Ms_098]\n\n\n“Yes Al King is gone somewhere where at we are not able to say” Ella said complacently —\n\n\n        They had a long talk. near the conclusion Herbert said “well perhaps it is best for him for I came up here with the intention of whipping thoroughly” he then went over to the mill to see his old friend Hugh Walters.\n\n\n\n\n        “Well Hugh you are millering alone I see” said p Herbert as he shook his friend’s hand.\n\n\n        “Yes I am alone” Hugh said “and I am glad of it if it was not for one thing that is Al King is suspected of attempting to murder young miss Sowers I hope he may come back soon and prove his innocence or confess his crime for I call it nothing less than a crime” They talked a good while perhaps upon subjects that would not interest the Reader. So we will not rehearse them.\n\n\n        We will give more attention to Joshua Sowers. he was sitting on his porch in a deep study as usual.\n\n\n        “let see” said he to himself “the detective will be here by Saturday morning if not sooner. I wish he was here now. I want to get on the intended assassins track as soon as possible”\n\n\n[PAGE 107: SC0313_Ms_099]\n\n\n        dinner was announced and they all went promptly to it after this was over we follow Ella to the sick room and find Mattie with a high fever and raving Mrs Barton came up in the afternoon and stayed awhile and about four o’clock Dr. Maltby came. he looked at his patient for some time finally he turned to Ella and said\n\n\n        “Miss Ella I will give you a sign to go by. This is the third day of April if any change takes place the eleventh why you can decide for yourself namely if she gets better that day She will be pretty certain to rally — if she gets worse her chances are small”\n\n\n        “Well I will look anxiously forward for that day” Ella said earnestly and the doctor said as he rose to go\n\n\n        “Miss Ella if you follow my directions implicitly you may rest assured that the change will be for the better and so until tomorrow Au revoir”\n\n\n\n\n        “Good evening doctor” said Ella as he finished speaking the doctor hurried off for home\n\n\n[PAGE 108: SC0313_Ms_100]\n\n\n        The great one has ordained time to go fast it must obey. So it was not long after the doctor left before the great day god was slowly sinking behind the western hills. about nine o’clock P.M. on entering Mrs Sowers chamber we find her on her knees entreating the great one to spare her child.\n\n\n        Ella was sitting by Mattie’s bed thinking of her lover and wondering where he was. It would have been a tedious task for some persons to sit there by that sick bed all the time It was not to Ella\n\n\n        Sitting there in one of her reveries she did not see two tigerish eyes gleaming with malice fixed upon her nor did she see a figure try to raise the window. did she hear that voice saying “I will kill her if I get a chance?” no she sat there all unconscious of the danger she was in suddenly there was a pistol pointed at her through the window — there was a loud report and a still louder scream and all was still — !\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n[PAGE 109: SC0313_Ms_101]\n\n\n        We said in our last chapter that Dr. Maltby went directly home after leaving Brookland.

This lady was not very well. \n\n\n        When he was seated and the customary questions about health &c.[as][at] were through with. mrs King asked her old question over again\n        “you have heard nothing of Albert since morning I suppose.” she said this enquiringly. \n        “No madam nothing as yet but I hope he will show himself before long.” the Doctor said evasively. He did not tell her of Albert being suspected of stabbing Mattie Sowers nor did he tell her of a Detective being put on his track. “How is miss sowers this evening doctor?” said Mrs King “Well she is not any better” said the doctor hesitatingly “I dont suppose they have heard from William Reed yet have they doctor” Mrs King said. trying to get her mind off of [word possibly crossed out] Albert\n\n\n[PAGE 110: SC0313_Ms_102]\n\n\n“no they have not” the doctor said and then he added— “William made a blunder when he took the notion not to write until he was ready to come home” “Why did he make such a promise as that doctor?” “Yes and I think it was a perfect blunder”\n“Where did he expect to go if he didn’t do well in Chicago”\n“The last time I saw him he said he would go to California if he couldn’t do well in Chicago”\n“doctor did you ever notice he is just the picture of my boy. a stranger could not tell one from the other after they were seen together and then to see them separate do you think so?”\n\n\n“no I do not beleive [au]they could they are very much alike”\n\n\n        “What a nice companion will would be with Al”\n“Yes they would indeed.

King I know something of the depth of a mother’s love I had as kind a mother as ever lived”The doctor said feelingly and he /[av][aw] added. \n\n\n        “you must calm yourself I will tell you that you must make yourself as calm as possible”\n\n\n        “Well I will try to do so doctor and I hope he will soon be found or soon return” after a short pause she asked..\n        “Who is attending Mattie doctor?”\n\n\n        “Miss Ella Armstead.

I dont flatter I dont know how to flatter” Mrs. King said laughingly. \n        “Well we will turn our conversation in another channel” the doctor said “in the first place I saw the new miller and he is a fine looking young man I’ll vouch for that”\n\n\n        “What is his name doctor?” inquired Mr [ay]King\n\n\n        “Hugh Walters is his name.

She looked at the picture and said\n        \n“Why that is a photograph of my Brother The Brother I was telling you about– he had that taken when he was but twenty years of age.”\n\n\nThe doctor studied it for some time and then said– “I would have declared it to be William Reed if I was a man of quick decision”\n\n\n“It looks more like Albert I think for I do not know why it should favor William Reed he is no relative of ours” the doctor didn’t say anything again for some time but the old proverb says still water runs deep and it’s modern addition is ‘The devil’s at the bottom’ finally the doctor said. \n\n\n“Well who is he any how? I do not think he is Wilson Reed’s son he is altogether a different man from Wilse” Mrs King said hesitatingly\n\n\n“No doctor I have often thought perhaps he was not Wilse Reed’s son after all. Why I have Seen Wilse and he is no more like William than chalk is like cheese”\n\n\n[PAGE 114: SC0313_Ms_106]\n\n\n        “Well it is no use for us to try to solve the mystery”the doctor said dryly. \n\n\n        “You dont really think there is mystery do you doctor?” the doctor seemed overconfident as he said “Very likely there is at least I think so”\n\n\n        “Well it does seem strange” Said Mrs. King it does seem strange that William Reed is the son of so repulsive a looking man as Wilse Reed” \n\n\n        “yes and I’ll find out for certain if it takes half my time” Said the doctor confidently\n\n\n        “It would be very romantic if he would prove to be some rich man’s son” said Mrs. King pertly\n        “Yes it would be very romantic but not too much so to be true”\n\n\n        “Well I would like to see him come out well and prove himself a Trump” Mrs. King said enthusiastically and after awhile she added\n\n\n        “I would not hate for him to be my nephew or near relative for he is a nice young man”\n\n\n        “Well if i was a married man and had such a noble fellow as he is for my son I would thank heaven” Our hero is gone dear Reader but he has left a good many friends behind will they know him when he comes back?

This over the doctor went out to ^(see) some other patients of his as he rode along in his buggy he muttered. “that’s a foolish idea I have got but I cant help thinking that William Reed  is not Wilse Reed’s son” he rode out the. Plank, Road to see a patient of his however he soon returned he went to his office and stayed awhile. Then went in the Parlor and stayed until nine o’clock from there to bed and about eleven o’clock he was called again by Jack. Jack said\n\n\n        “Marse please hurry down to Marse Sowers’ house somebody shot through the window at miss Mattie or Miss Ella one or de oder[ba][bb]”\n\n\n        “Why Jack some one must have a great strife at your folks I should think” said the doctor as he hurried to get ready to go when they were started the doctor said\n\n\n        “Well Jack you have not told me what was the matter with your people did the pistol [illegible last line[bc]– could be “shot hurt anyone?””]\n\n\n[PAGE 116: SC0313_Ms_108]\n\n\n        “Why Marse Doctor I was was so e’cited I had done forgot to tell you what was de matter— de fact is dis de ball from de pistol struck de head of Miss Mattie’s bed and it sceared her into hysterics we’s afeard she wont recover shure ‘nuff now” after a pause the doctor asked\n\n\n        “Was anyone in the room beside miss mattie?”\n\n\n        “no sah de— yes Sah dey was miss Ella was in dere an’ she is a brave young lady she didn’t scream or hollar but Miss Mattie hollered awful” they soon reached Mr Sowers residence. \n\n\n        he was greatly agitated because of his troubles he met the doctor at the door. \n\n\n        “Oh doctor” said he “who do you think it really is? Who can have any spite at me? is it Some one I have — he paused and lead the way up stairs the doctor soon examined Mattie and gave her such medicine as was needed But he said it was best for him to stay a couple of hours. in about an hour they all left the room except Doctor Maltby and Ella They soon got to conversing in low tones\n\n\n        “Miss Ella a penny for your thoughts?”\n        The doctor said mischeviously.[bd] \n\n\n[PAGE 117: SC0313_Ms_109]\n\n\n        “My thoughts are not worth a penny doctor”\n\n\n        “Well give them to me if you please anyway”\n\n\n        “I am thinking that my thoughts at present would not interest anyone”\n\n\n        “Well since you wont tell me your thoughts I will tell you what they are”\n\n\n        “What are they doctor?”\n        \n        “They are of William I am certain now aint they?”\n\n\n        “Ella would not hesitate to speak ^(the truth) so she said “Yes doctor they were—I was thinking of Will[Page torn, likely missing “iam”] when you first spoke”\n\n\n        [Page torn; half page missing]\n\n\n[PAGE 118: SC0313_Ms_110]\n\n\n“no indeed sir I did not scream the first thing I did was to try to keep Mattie from getting out of the bed” said Ella succinctly. \n\n\n        “Well did the noise arouse the house?” The doctor asked after a few moment’s silence \n\n\n        “Yes sir mr Sowers soon came in here and he said such strange words”\n\n\n        “What were they” inquired Dr. Maltby\n\n\n        “Why he said as he saw what was done ‘oh god is this done to avenge those I have—’ he did not say any more doctor”\n\n\n        “he done the same way down in the hall” said the doctor interestedly\n\n\n        “Well” said Ella “I am satisfied there is some one been wronged by him”\n\n\n        “perhaps there is and perhaps there is — not” returned the doctor. Their conversation ran on Thus for some time but we will not tire the Reader in giving all the details as they might not be interesting. we will ask one question and in the course of time we will answer that question. \n\n\n        Who was it that was trying so hard to kill Mattie Sowers? Our Readers suspect who it was each time the person was dressed in miller’s close\n\n\n[PAGE 119: SC0313_Ms_111]\n\n\nclothes was it Albert King? or who was it? we shall find out. The night was passing along soon very soon the darkness would have to make way for the light Jack and aunt Sally were sitting by the fire they had a little fire for it was still They were afraid to go to bed. \n\n\n        “Jack I cant tink fur my life what is de matter wid de people” said aunt Sally\n\n\n        “No indeed honey I cant to save my life I cant think what is de matter wid ‘em” she said again after a short pause. \n        “Well Sally it’s no use to be bodderin’ yourself about somethin’ you knows nothin’about but I am goin to have a drink o’whiskey as sure as you’re born” said uncle Jack conclusively and he went to his jug and helped himself. He came back staggering. \n\n\n        “Now Jack you knows it was jist yestidday dat marse Josh lectured you on de faults o’drinkin’ whisky” “Yes (hic) sally (hic) I know (hic) he did but (hic) lecturing aint whippin’ so I conten’ it’s rite to drink as much as I please”\n\n\n[PAGE 120: SC0313_Ms_112]\n\n\nabout this time Dr. Maltby was heard coming down he hurried home to bed for he was very tired and he needed rest. \n\n\n        It was two o’clock when he got to his office he left Ella at the bedside of Mattie sowers there was little or no change in Mattie. \n\n\n        So there Ella sat in an untiring watch She She refused to have any one with her for she knew it would only interrupt her reveries She fell into a reverie as soon as the doctor left her Thoughts soon came to words she muttered\n\n\n        “Oh I hope dear Willie is safe. I know it must be Al King that is trying to kill poor Mattie” \n\n\n        and so leaving her thinking of her lover and dearest friend we turn our attention Elsewhere immediately.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n\n[PAGE 121: SC0313_Ms_113]\n\n\n        It was Saturday morning. nothing had occurred during the three intervening days worth recording. Mattie Sowers was still hovering between life and death Such a true balance that the least furtherance at the adverse side the balance would tilt.\n        The people of Brookland were astir early. especially Mr Sowers for apart from his devotion for his daughter nothing was on his mind but the Detective the man that was to expose him but he did not know it — he did not know that the detective that was coming was the identical man. he told Wilse to _________ I will not say what he told Wilse to do It was not a kind act. as soon as Sowers got his breakfast he n went to Winchester and stayed until the ten o’clock train came as soon as the train ‘Slowed’ he was gazing eagerly into the Passenger. car. he saw an elderly man get out but that was not his ‘beau ideal’ of a detective. he was looking for a keen looking man. Will this detective going to be keen enough for him? Time will tell. he was startled a little when the elderly man\n\n\n[PAGE 122: SC0313_Ms_114]\n\n\n        gave him a slight tap on the shoulder and said [÷] “this is Mr Sowers I presume”\n\n\n“Yes I am the man that they call Sowers. — What is your business with me?” said Sowers stiffly.\n\n\n        “You sent for me. and more you must not talk so loud you must not let anyone know that I am a detective”  the detective said slowly.\n\n\n        “how am I to prevent it?” inquired Sowers\n\n\n“well here” said the detective as he drew a note out of his pocket “here, take this and have those words telegraphed to New York immediately I have made it all right there”\n\n\nSowers read the note there was only a few words written. They were those [÷]\n\n\n        “I have concluded that it wont do any good to send a detective so dont send him.” “J. Sowers”\n\n\nafter he had attended to this he went home. he and the detective. Whose name was Kent. the detective whiled away the whole day trying to pick up ‘clue’s’ as they term it. he found no clue’s that day the next day was Sunday and of course he attended church with Mr Sowers he had to do so as he had been entered at Brookland as one of Mr Sowers’ New. England. friends. Well Sunday\n\n\n[PAGE 123: SC0313_Ms_115]\n\n\npassed and other days went by as it seemed in quick succession. in fact it was the eleventh day of april the day that mattie’s fate was to be decided the day that the balance was to tilt either one way or the other.\n\n\n        What an anxious look was in those parents’ eyes. how eagerly they watched for the fatal moment when the balance would tilt.\n\n\n        The change came at last — the invalid smiled! oh how that mothers’ heart beat how her lips sent up fervent thanks to heaven for the change in her child. Dr Maltby was standing at the bedside a smile of satisfaction rested on his bronzed face. he looked around at the anxious faces of all present and said in a confident way.\n\n\n        “now I call myself a skillful physician I leave to yourselves the opportunity of contradicting my assertion” as he ceased speaking Mr Sowers advanced to him and said in a trembling — yet fervent voice “I can shape no words to tell you what how much I owe you for saving my daughter’s life” the old man clasped the doctor’s hand and\n\n\n[PAGE 124: SC0313_Ms_116]\n\n\nshook it fervently, tears stood in his eyes his athlete-frame shook with emotion. he could hold his peace no longer\n\n\n        “Oh doctor I have erred greatly all my life my whole life has been one fatal error and those I have ____” he paused again he could not say the words he had intended to say. We will not dwell upon those scenes long let it suffice for us to say that Mattie’s recovery was very slow but she mended day by day and time wore on. the soon the month[be][bf] of April passed away and we again pick up our story on the first of May\n\n\n        Mattie was sitting at her window on this fine morning she had not come left her room since that fatal night when she was stabbed.\n\n\n        She looked beautiful as S She sat there her raven locks falling in hanging far down her b back She was very pale yet beautiful.\n\n\n        Dr. Maltby came in to see her about ten o’clock that morning. his orders were she should not leave her room for some time yet. although a month had passed since the opening of our story, no clue had been found of the intended assassin. Kent was a shrewd man but this was a\n\n\n[PAGE 125: SC0313_Ms_117]\n\n\npuzzling mystery to him.\n\n\n        Albert King had not been seen or heard of. William Reed had not been heard of in fact the absence of a Al. King and the silence of William Reed seemed ominous. Why should Al. King absent himself? or what was his motive for so doing? Well the detective’s conclusion was that Albert l King was the intended assassin. was his conclusion correct? was Albert King hiding as a fugitive from the law?\n\n\n        Wilse Reed always shunned the detective. Kent was a jealous detective he had searched every inch of Frederick and Clarke counties it seemed and he paid particular attention to Ash Hollow he went there every day of his life. Ash Hollow is in Frederick county about four miles from Winchester and the Berryville road goes through this Hollow. at the time of which we write this Hollow was infested by robbers robbers that would not hesitate to murder a man for money or other valuables.\n\n\n[PAGE 126: SC0313_Ms_118]\n\n\n        Well to return to the subject Kent was sorely puzzled as he sat he sat on the porch at Mr Sowers conversing with that personage\n        “Well Mr Sowers” said Kent despairingly I[bg] never was so puzzled in all my life here it is the first day of May and I am no mor in the light than I were when I first came”\n\n\n        “no I thought you were more shrewd than you are” said Sowers dryly.\n\n\n        “I am no more shrewd than you dream I am” said the detective meaningly\n\n\n        “Whether you are shrewd or not I know you have been a good while trying to pick up a clue and you are no further than you were at first” said Sowers bluntly\n\n\n        “now Sowers I dont want any such talk as that here I have done all I or anyone else could do and I tell you that before I leave Virginia you will think I can find a clue to anything I want want to. you’ll find me out I tell you before I leave your premises” Kent said sharply\n\n\n        “Well dont get excited Kent” said Sowers “I wont talk so anymore”\n\n\n[PAGE 127: SC0313_Ms_119]\n\n\n“all right all right Mr Sowers we will not fall out about this little parley” after a short pause Kent added “I have other ends to serve yet” They soon parted Kent went over to the mill as he was very fond of talking to Hugh Walters he found Herbert Armstead at the mill they all went into the office and seated themselves they then began conversing on first one topic and then another, finally the conversation turned to William Reed.\n\n\n        “Herbert I think we had better ‘Go West’” said Hugh laughingly — “Well” he added “we might do s splendid dont you think so Mr. Kent?”\n\n\n“Yes you young people might do pretty well” answered Kent.\n\n\n“this is Thursday the first day of May” commented H Herbert languidly. “I would like to hear from William about now. he has been gone one month tomorrow. I hope he’ll not stay away much longer”\n\n\n“Ah! my friends” said the det detective drawlly. i[bh]f William has got his fortune to make you will not see him soon I tell you” \n\n\n[PAGE 128: SC0313_Ms_120]\n\n\n        “he said he would go to California if he could get a chance” replied Herbert “we will let him go at that for the present”\n\n\n        none but the most trustworthy portion of the inhabitants of Brookland, knew that David. Kent. was a detective. Herbert. and Hugh. knew that he was a detective. there was a short silence and during the interval the detective mused thus to himself\n        “I am thoroughly convinced” thought he “thoroughly convinced that this Joshua Sowers is my man I have seen him before under auspicious circumstances I was convinced on the day of my arrival that I had my man” he ceased his misty meanderings an said aloud to his companions \n        “This Al King is a mystery to me why he should keep himself hid is more than I can understand” Wilse Reed entered at this juncture and also Mr. Sowers this gentleman seated himself near the window and said [÷]\n\n\n        “Why Kent you seem melancholy today what’s the matter?” Kent didn’t know that w Wilse Reed knew he was a detective so he said\n\n\n        “I don’t feel very well today I think I had better go down to Jordan’s Springs and get a good\n\n\n[PAGE 129: SC0313_Ms_121]\n\n\n        drink of Sulphur Water.” so saying he rose and took his leave. as he left the room he gave one s swift but keen glance at Wilse.\n\n\n        Wilse quivered with fear: Kent got a horse and started off for Jordan’s Springs a springs well known to pleasure seekers throughout Virginia we will accompany him to said resort and back he rode along slowly musing all the time..\n        “Well I have three ends to serve” said he S “Sowers dont know me but I know him. know him” he repeated “Why I know him to a. T. and — well I wont be over-confident about one of the ends I have to serve” he rode on for some distance in silence. though his mind was full of theories. finally his thoughts came to words again.\n        “Yes that other personage is my prey too I was sent as much for him as anyone else”\n\n\n        Reader here is a space for you to form theories. Who did Kent allude to when he said ‘that other personage was his prey? some theory can be formed from that sentence.\n\n\n[PAGE 130: SC0313_Ms_122]\n\n\n        Well we will follow the New. Englander as the Virginia people called Kent. he took a good drink. of sulphur water as he said he would and then seated himself on a rustic bench. he fell to musing again. It was a pretty very pretty May day the birds in the park at Jordan’s were warbling their beautiful. enchanting notes, any one who had nothing to bear on their could enjoy the scene — Kent took no notice of it he was thinking of home and friends he had left at his New England home.\n\n\n        “I must accomplish what I came for” said he as he carelessly surveyed the scenery at his leisure “I want to see the wronged righted before I leave V Virginia. I dont like the place very well every time a colored person speaks to me it’s “marse Kent” I dont like it myself” he rose and mounting his horse rode off toward Brookland. he soon arrived there and Jack was ready to put his horse away.\n\n\n“Marse Kent” — began Jack. but he was cut short by Kent saying\n        “look here my good fellow you will please to call me Kent it suits me better”\n\n\n[PAGE 131: SC0313_Ms_123]\n\n\n“Well marse I has no dejecshuns only de white folks” said Jack humbly.\n\n\n“Well I dont want to meddle with you or your master’s business but I dont want to be called “Marse” anymore if you please the word is disgusting any way” said Kent. and he looked disgusted.\n\n\n        he went in and eat his dinner as it was dinner time. Sowers was at the table when he entered “we are waiting for you Mr Kent” said Sowers as he looked up from the table when Kent entered “yes sir like one hog waits for another” said Kent and added he “the words are not complimental but as we a are old friends” — with a slight wink — “I hope you will take notice of it”\n\n\n        “Oh no all jokes are free on the first day of May” said Sowers laughingly\n\n\n        “‘Like to the Roman actor who of old \nwore the false mask so long his features took\nthe impress of the bronze’”[bi] repeated Kent to himself as he took his seat at the table: Herbert Armstead was there on that day as he was still looking for Albert King as he said\n\n\n[PAGE 132: SC0313_Ms_124]\n\n\n        “how is your daughter?” asked Kent.\n\n\n        “She is feeling pretty well today thank you” answered Sowers. after a few moments silence Mrs Sowers said [÷]\n        “I think it would be advisable to take her to some one of the spring’s — Rock-bridge.-- Alum. for instance”\n\n\n        “Yes it would be advisable” said Kent as he rose from the table. he eyed Wilse again. suspiciously. he walked close up to Wilse as they went down through the yard\n        “I think we have met before” said he in a low voice. there was an air of bravado in Wilse Reed’s voice as he said \n        “Very likely.”\n\n\nChapter XII\n\n\n[PAGE 133: SC0313_Ms_125]\n\n\n        “Did I understand you to say that it was very likely we had met before?” continued the detective “yes you understood me alright” replied Wilse changing color a little “I have been a great traveler mr Kent and is it more than ^(likely) that we should have met before?”\n\n\n        “Oh no it is no more than likely .. I hope I have not been too inquisitive Sir?”\n\n\n        “Oh no there is no harm done” replied Wilse. \n\n\n        One peculairity[bj] about Kent was that he had never called Wilse Reed by any name when he referred to him he always said ‘your wagoner’ Mr. Sowers took a little notice of it but not much he had other things on his mind. \n\n\n        We will visit Mattie again;[bk] She was sitting in her easy chair reading when Ella Armstead entered: \n\n\n        “Dearest Ella” Said she  “you are always so kind to me I dont know how to repay you”\n\n\n        “You can make speedy reparation by not mentioning mentioning it Matte” said Ella in a low sweet voice She had a tray of food which She deposited on a low stand neare[bl] Mattie\n\n\n[PAGE 134: SC0313_Ms_126]\n\n\n        “Ella have you heard from William yet?” queried Mattie\n\n\n        “No indeed I have not heard from him” Said Ella gloomily. “Were you engaged to him when he went away? come now Ella tell me for it will be confidential and Strictly private” Ella was Silent for awhile then she answered\n        \n        “Yes we are betrothed but I dont want to be telling everybody. Ah wouldn’t I like to see him now” They were silent for a few moments then Mattie said good humoredly [÷]\n\n\n        “I have been looking over some of Byron’s poems and poetry and I was wondering if your affianced was like one of Byron’s characters here are the words. \n\n\n        ‘She deemed that time, he deemed that pride. \n        Had quenched at last, his boyish flame\n        Nor knew till seated, by her side\n        His heart in all save hope the same’ that is it I wonder if your William is that way?”\n\n\n        “I daresay he is. at least I trust he is” replied Ella. They conversed for sometime on different subjects but we will not tire the Reader as their conversation might not be \n\n\n[PAGE 135: SC0313_Ms_127]\n\n\ninteresting. so we will go with Mr. Sowers as soon as he finished his dinner he went to the Stable he found Wilse there—\n\n\n“Wilse how did you and the detective make it?” inquired sowers as he took a seat on the steps. \n\n\n        “Oh we made it well enough and if I am not mistaken I have seen that man before, I don’t know exactly where but I have seen him before” replied Wilse readily. \n\n\n“Well I have a notion to discharge him he isn’t doing any good” Said Sowers. \n\n\n        “I don’t believe he is trying to do any good that is my beleif[bm]” commented Wilse. he did not know that an eavesdropper was near. but such was the fact a man was laying in the hay just over Wilse. Reed’s head. he heard every word uttered by Wilse and Sowers. the man was no other person than David. Kent. he laid very still to hear more he hadn’t long to wait for Wilse began again\n\n\n        “Well Sowers” said he “I want some money tonight for my employee”\n\n\n[PAGE 136: SC0313_Ms_128]\n\n\n        “how are you going to get it to him?” inquired Sowers. \n\n\n        “Oh I will get it to him easy enough” answered Wilse “and to tell the truth” he added “I don’t think he is doing much out there”\n\n\n        “I am sorry I ever went into this plot” said Sowers gravely “It has been a miserable revenge a miserable revenge I can tell you and I’ll bet She has suffered enough for it”\n\n\n        “I think it has been as miserable to you as it could have been to you” said Wilse. \n\n\n        “Yes I know it has” replied Sowers “I have suffered as much as she”\n\n\n        “Kent started at hearing those revelations says he to himself “I ought to go down and arrest them both if the — well I wont do anything with but one I will shame the other. I will let them off this time”\n\n\n        he had hardly ceased speaking when Wilse said “Well sowers meet me at the ledge after you get that confounded Kent to bed meet me at eleven o’clock”\n\n\n        “All right Wilse I’ll be there” replied Sowers and I hope it is the last time I’ll go there”\n\n\n[PAGE 137: SC0313_Ms_129]\n\n\n        “That is for that purpose” corrected Wilse. “anyway at all. if my daughter was not in such a precarious condition I would tell Kent all,” replied Sowers desperately. \n\n\n        “Yes you will either tell me all or else I will tell you all” thought Kent. \n\n\n        “Tell all on yourself dont implicate me” said Wilse deliberately. \n\n\n        “Well if I tell what i done I will be compelled to tell what you done” replied Sowers. “Mark my words Sowers if you do so you do it at your peril!” then Wilse thought and said to himself “Oh if he knew how  utterly powerless I am to harm him he would defy me” Kent was listening all the time. and treasuring up every word. \n\n\n        “if I only knew where William. Reed. or Albert King is I would bring every thing to a close” Thought Kent \n\n\n        “but as it is I will abide my time” continued he\n\n\n        “I must go to town this afternoon” Said\n\n\n[PAGE 138: SC0313_Ms_130]\n\n\nSowers. as he rose to go. he and Wilse went out of the stable and Kent stole down as quietly as he had Stole up, he had made a confidante of Hugh. Walters. So he proceeded to the mill at once to tell Hugh he knew Hugh was a trustworthy man. \n\n\n        “Hugh I want to tell you something” Said Kent as he seated himself on the husk beside one of the Burrs. “I never did make a confidante of a young man before but I hope you are one that can keep a secret”\n\n\n        “Oh yes I can keep a secret and I will keep a secret” replied Hugh. \n\n\n        Kent then related his adventure to Hugh. \n\n\n        “I know that there is something going on between Wilse and Sowers” Said Hugh. \n\n\n        “Well all we have got to do is maintain silence” Said Kent advisedly. “‘bide our time” says he after a short pause “and we’ll come out all right”\n\n\n        “Yes I believe that all you say is True” replied Hugh “and I hope I may live to see the wronged ones righted.”\n\n\n        “and they shall be if live to see autumn.! just as sure as you are sitting there the. \n\n\n[PAGE 139: SC0313_Ms_131]\n\n\nwronged shall be righted!” Those were the words of Kent the detective. \n\n\n        “you seem to be confident of your ability in doing justice” said Hugh smilingly. \n\n\n        “I am confident it will only shame one but the other will have to be dealt with according to law” Said the detective impressively. \n\n\n        “here comes the proprietor” said Hugh. and as Sowers entered the office Kent and Hugh let on they were busy ciphering. \n\n\n        “Mr. Kent I have concluded I would give over hunting for Al King I dont believe you will succeed in finding him” commented Sowers as he took a seat but Kent wasn’t going to be thwarted in his plans so he said imperatively [÷]\n\n\n        “Mr. Sowers I must and will succeed. I came here for that purpose. Albert. King must be found” Sowers said no more for some time. he was busy thinking. \n\n\n        “Well” said he breaking the silence “If you will you will”  “yes officers must do our duty in all transactions” said Kent\n\n\n[PAGE 140: SC0313_Ms_132]\n\n\n        Sowers went out in the mill and left Hugh and Kent in the office\n\n\n        “just to think of such a man as Sowers making a confidante of Wilse” Kent said gravely “and then tell me about giving it up I’ll ask him if he is trusting to me fully and I’ll ask him also if he has anyone in his confidence that he has not told me me about.”\n\n\n        So when Sowers came in Kent asked \n\n\n        “Mr Sowers have you been trusting in me fully to work up this case?”\n\n\n        Yes I have but you are not making any progress” Said Sowers readily. \n\n\n        “Well I have another question to ask never mind about the the[bn] ‘progression’” reiterated Kent\n\n\n        “have you any one in your confidence beside those I know of?”\n\n\n        Sowers paled. The muscles of his face quivered for an instant. Then he made a powerful effort at self-control and said boldly though the lie stung him “No Sir I have not.”\n\n\n        The words sounded hollow as he uttered them the detective smiled his satisfaction. Sowers left the mill and went to his house\n\n\n[PAGE 141: SC0313_Ms_133]\n\n\nas soon as he was out of hearing. Kent said to Hugh gleefully. \n\n\n        “he is a first class liar. but I’ll bring him to the knowledge of the truth as sure as he lives. ha! ha! ha! hurrah! hurrah!” he laughed a long hearty laugh. \n\n\n        “Hugh Walters you will see fun before a great while” continued Kent still laughing\n\n\n        “I hope it will be fun instead of sorrow” said Hugh. “it’s three o’clock already” continued he in another tone\n\n\n        “I tell you Hugh we will find Al. King time enough to complete our fun” Kent said to his companion. \n\n\n        We will give a description of Kent. he was an elderly man as previously stated. with raven black hair abo he was about five feet six inches in height and weighed about one hundred-and Sixty. pounds he had a fair complexion for his age. he was a jolly man in general —persevering– honest and industrious. he was ever a ready ally to defend the right and offend the wrong\n\n\n[PAGE 142: SC0313_Ms_134]\n\n\nhis history was simple. we will speak more of it hereafter. let it suffice now for us to say he had been the hero of a perilous adventure in his younger days. \n\n\n        “That ledge business I am interested in” Said Kent after a few moments silence. \n\n\n        “do you think you will go down to see and be seen” queried Hugh. \n\n\n        “No I will not go down to see and be seen but I go to see and not be seen” laughed Kent \n\n\n        “You’ll go to bed and then get up and creep down there” suggested Hugh. \n\n\n        “Yes I’ll take mr. Sowers as a guide as soon as he goes down I’ll climb out of my window and follow at a good distance” Said Kent. and so the evening slipped away at supper Kent talked as much as usual he had a little chat with Ella. \n\n\n        “Miss Ella how is your patient?” said he by way of commencement. \n\n\n        “She is getting along finely thank you” replied Ella. She was called ‘nurse’ at Brookland. because she was so proficient in that proff profession. Supper finished they all advanced to their\n\n\n[PAGE 143: SC0313_Ms_135]\nposts. Ella to the sick-room. Sowers. Kent. and Hugh to the mill. Wilse to the stable. It was a clear beautiful evening all nature seemed to be smiling. \n\n\n        as soon as Sowers could get to himself he murmured. “I beleive[bo] Kent knows something of my former life. he looks at me so curiously I will get him away as soon as possible.”\n\n\n        The evening soon passed. at nine o’clock Sowers and Kent started to the house\n\n\n        They sat in the dining room for a few minutes Kent was thinking of the adventure he anticipated participating in. he was determined he would not close his eyes in Sleep until he followed. Sowers to the ledge. and heard what was said he had been successful in the haymow enterprise why not be successful in this?\n\n\n        They went to bed but neither went to Sleep one was compelled to keep awake, the other was determined to do so. it was a warm night so Kent raised his window to let in air of course. Why not? \n\n\n[PAGE 144: SC0313_Ms_136]\n\n\n        The detective was impatient for the time to pass it never did seem so long to him from nine to eleven o’clock in all of his previous life. \n\n\n        Finally the hour came. he heard stealthy footsteps in the hall they came nearer and nearer then they were exactly opposite his door Then they recedeed in the distance and died out altogether and the detective rose with an exclamation thus [÷] “I’ll see who will get there first! I’ll be a match for you”  So saying he quickly made his Exit out of the window and started off rapidly but cautiously [marked out word] toward the underbrush over the ledge of rocks!\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\n\n[PAGE 145: SC0313_Ms_137]\n\n\n        The town clock Struck three. Dr. Maltby Dr. Maltby. was sitting in his office Misty memories floated before him. The weight of long and crushing years seemed rolled away from the Doctor’s mind as if by magic he could not lift the mystic vail and peer into the future. but he could look back over the past. he could see plainly the bright days when he was a school-boy. then the days when he was a young man.\n\n\n        When he first Started out in the world. to seek his fortune. expecting to return and claim a wife in the land of his birth. he had been successful in obtaining his fortune. returned to his native home. to tell her, who had promised him her hand — her heart and hand, that he had the ‘cage’ prepared — what was his consternation when he found the ‘bird’ had flown! he had started out as a mere, adventurer from the Eastern hills. had journeyed to the far West and there he became a Physician. he stayed until he made a fortune\n\n\n[PAGE 146: SC0313_Ms_138]\n\n\nthen returned his hopes ran high but they were soon blighted. and in the bitter sorrow of his heart he vowed he would hunt the whole earth over. he would scan every female face in the whole earth.\n\n\n        he accordingly Searched every State in the United. States. all over Virginia until he came to Winchester he had been in Winchester for a considerable Period. and just thinking of starting for the Old. World. when he had at last caught sight of a face that resembled the one he had been looking for for So many years. he was determined to stay now and see this face once more.\n\n\n        Oh! pen cannot depict the Sorrow of a heart starving for love. All those memories floated before him as vividly as if it had all occurred but, yesterday then the thought came did she ever love him? or did she trifle with his affections? no he would not believe that. the very idea was preposterous.\n\n\n        the words — tender words of love she had spoken to him — every word that came to\n\n\n[PAGE 147: SC0313_Ms_139]\n\n\nhis mind, was, like an, additional, arrow, peircing[bp] his already, bleeding heart.\n\n\n        no he would not stand it any longer, he would enquire into this person former life this person that so strikingly resembled his betrothed. – the one who had all of his heart though he knew not where she was. but where ever she was — if She was on the island of Terra.–del.–Feugo his heart was with her he knew not that a messenger would bring him knews[bq] of the lost one. but he was destined soon — very soon to hear of his only love. and he was also destined to see her Some time in the course, of human events.\n\n\n        enough — we will not attempt to raise the mystic vail and peer into the future we will let the future alone until it comes to be the Present then we will say what there is to say.\n\n\n        the Doctor still sat there. he was deeply absorbed in the memories of the past\n\n\n[PAGE 148: SC0313_Ms_140]\n\n\n        The future seemed still more puzzling he held a miniature in his hand — tears? yes tears stood in his eyes — Slowly they rolled down his cheeks — fast — now faster did they roll one by one they fell in quick succession they were not tears of remorse or Shame. They were simply tears of Sorrow — heartfelt Sorrow — they were the tears of love — tears of a starving heart — starving for love for unrequited love? We hope not — we hope the love was to be requited some day.\n\n\n        he pressed the miniature to his lips again and again, his whole frame shook and quivered with emotion. in vain did he try to console himself — in vain did he try to put the miniature aside — he could not — something compelled him to hold it — to gaze on it the smile that rested on the face of that picture peirced his innermost soul. \n        \n        how many times had he seen that face Smile in reality — how many times had he saw that “Kiss me if you can” mouth open and Speak words of love. he had heard that mouth — or words proceed from that mouth who\n\n\n[PAGE 149: SC0313_Ms_141]\n\n\nthat made his life seem renewed with manly vigor. “Oh would to God I could forget the past!” was his only c cry.\n        Why forget the past?\n\n\n        “Will I ever see peace and enjoyment any more? Will I ever be happy again?” groaned he in his bitter reflections. perhaps Mrs. King’s brother had won his betrothed from him if he had what would be the consequence? a thousand theories presented themselves to him as he sat there in his despair Was it despair? no it was hope — hope until the last. he also had a letter in his hand he read it over and over and over again it was a letter he had received while he was but a short distance from his native home he was a native of the United. States. to be sure but still he was a good long distance from his native town — the town where he was born and grew up in he read the letter again we will give out\n\n\n[PAGE 150: SC0313_Ms_142]\n\n\n        Reader a few words of the letter it was written in a clear delicate hand. and ran as follows. – “I hope I will see you again soon dear Robert and dont doubt my love for you no one Shall ever have my heart I have given it to you my only love. as ever yours. Jennie”\n\n\n        That was all the name it had signed to it — the missive. “I may yet find her and She may be faithful still.” Said he.\n        “She may have married some one but I am confident she never gave anyone her heart. no she was too true. Oh I love her yet and will always love her may God bless her and if we do not meet in this world I know we Shall meet in Heaven”\n\n\n        he bowed his head on his knees and cried like a child. then he fell upon his knees and did as he had done many a time and oft before — he prayed unto God to guide him to his lost love — always ending his prayes[br] in this wise if He did not see fit for them to meet on earth let them meet in heaven. he rose from his knees and hurried away to see some of his patients.\n\n\n[PAGE 151: SC0313_Ms_143]\n\n\nhe returned to his office about five o’clock he soon went into the parlor, to have a chat with Mrs. King. he wanted to think more of the present and less of the past. however he concluded he would ask Mrs. King if She had any idea who her brother married So after the formal salutations were given he proceeded to business [÷]\n\n\n        “Mrs. King.” Said he “have you any idea who your brother would have been likely to have married, if he married any one?”\n\n\n        “Indeed I haven’t the least idea” answered Mrs. King. “I can dimly recollect hearing call a young girl he was going to see ‘Jennie’ or ‘dear Jennie’ I guess he married her if he married any one” Dr Maltby’s heavy frame quivered with emotion. This then was the one that had robbed him of his happiness. he had no thought of revenge. he was too much of a gentleman for that.\n\n\n        “did he ever call her any other name beside Jennie as you know of?” queried the doctor.\n\n\n[PAGE 152: SC0313_Ms_144]\n\n\n        “not as I remember – I dont remember hearing him call her by any other name Why was a person by that name a personal friend of yours that you have not heard of for sometime?” asked Mrs. King as she found her curiosity beginning to get excited.\n\n\n        “Well— y-e-s.” drawled the doctor somewhat reluctantly. Then he added trying to change the subject “this is the first day of many what a lovely day it is to be sure.”\n\n\n        “yes it is a very pretty day indeed” commented Mrs King Shrugging her shoulder. “a pretty day” continued she “and my Albert King still hidden in obscurity. Where do you think he can be doctor?” and she looked at the doctor appealingly. The doctor Spoke the truth when he said “I expect he is with William Reed. out West” We said he spoke the truth — w What we mean mean by that is that he spoke according to his beleif [bs]— not as he was sure that Albert King was with William. Reed. \n\n\n“Well I hope he’ll soon return” said she sadly \n\n\n“yes we will hope for the best always” said the doctor in a cheerful voice..\n\n\n[PAGE 153: SC0313_Ms_145]\n\n\n“doctor you may thank the mighty one that never had any children — that is that you were never married for children cause their parents a great deal of trouble”\n\n\n“Well it has to be just as God wills it. God said multiply and replenish the earth. I have no one to bear my name when I go hence while you have a son. Oh don't think my bachelor life is a happy one for it is not I am miserable”\n\n\n“And why miserable doctor? you have every comfort in life that anyone can have”\n\n\n“Mrs. King it is my heart — my heart is starving for companionship — for one I have always loved and always will love”\n\n\n“Doctor I did once think you had no heart — now I know you have a heart and a very tender heart you suffer very much” \n\n\n[PAGE 154: SC0313_Ms_146]\n\n\n        “We will speak no more on that subject if you please” said the doctor persuasively [÷]\n\n\n        they had talked — the one of her brother the other of his lost love yet in all their conversation the had called no names with the exception of ‘Jennie’.\n\n\n        “how is your patient at Brookland doctor?” queried Mrs. King after a thoughtful pause\n\n\n        “She is getting along very well with the exception of some severe head-aches” replied the doctor “as soon as they can take her out they are going to Rock. Bridge. Alum. Springs and stay awhile.”  “Why it will be a nice resort to be sure” said Mrs. King. flippantly.\n\n\n        “I have always heard that Rockbridge Alum is a very nice summer resort”\n\n\n“Yes madam it is a very nice place and it will be more than than beneficial to the speedy restoration of this young lady’s health”\n\n\n[PAGE 155: SC0313_Ms_147]\n\n\n        “have you asked her anything about that dreadful night doctor?”\n\n\n        “no we haven’t Said anything to her as yet and we will not venture to do so until she has thoroughly recovered her health She is in a very precarious condition yet. and it might cause additional Shock to her nerves”\n\n\n        “how are they all out there anyway? is Mr. Kent. Still at Sowers’ or has he finished his v visit and gone back home?”\n\n\n        “he is still there and I dont believe he is going away soon, he talks of going to the Springs with the Sowers family”\n\n\n        “I hear that he roves about a great deal through the woods’ and feilds”\n\n\n        “Yes he does rove about a great deal. in fact he is a stirring kind of a man and he never likes to be sitting around”\n\n\n[PAGE 156: SC0313_Ms_148]\n\n\n        “that may be the case. doctor is he very talkative or have you had a chance to talk with him?”\n\n\n        “Yes he is pretty talkative in general” answered the doctor dryly. he was left alone for sometime. finally supper was announced he eat his supper and went on another visit then he returned and Sat in the parlor with Mrs King until about ten o’clock he then returned to bed. little thinking of the revelation that was to be made to him on the morrow\n\n\n        the scene closes. it is eleven o’clock and we can dimly discern the outlines of a human figure going cautiously in the direction of the ledge of rocks intervening between Brookland Mills and the fine stately mansion of Joshua. Sowers. — listen as he proceeds we can identify him in the dim moonlight by his voice what does he say?\n\n\n        “I am playing two games and I will win both or my name aint Kent\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\n\n[PAGE 157: SC0313_Ms_149]\n\n\n        It was our old friend Kent. and as soon as he ceased Speaking he . crawled as near the edge of the precipice. as was Safe— he listened for some time finally he heard some one walking cautiously toward the ledge— Then he heard someone call out:  “all’s right Sowers. I am here just shell out your specie[bt][bu] at once.” he knew the voice well enough so he still listened. presently he heard Sowers say: “how much money do you want Wilse? I am getting tired of this”\n\n\n        “Sowers I want one hundred dollars!” he heard Wilsee. Reed say: “and if you tell me again that you are getting tired of this, I’ll tell the detective all I know about you, you old hypocrite. you you confounded reprobate I’ll tell !” all”\n\n\n[PAGE 158: SC0313_Ms_150]\n\n\n        Kent was drinking in every word eagerly. every word spoke volumes to him—he was sure now that he had the right one. \n\n\n        “name the amount wilse or did you name it? I will give you all the money you want for I dont want my daughter to heare[bv] of my treachery” Sowers said in a trembling voice. Kent was a kind hearted man. and he felt very sorry for Sowers; “I hate to do do it but I must do my duty” muttered Kent as he still crouched on the edge of the precipice. \n\n\n        “I said I wanted one hundred dollars.” Wilse Reed said bluntly. Then Kent heard the rattling of the silver and gold. he also heard Sowers say: \n\n\n        “there it is Wilse now I must hurry to the house my wife might miss me goodnight Wilse” “goodnight” Wilse said\n\n\n[PAGE 159: SC0313_Ms_151]\n\n\nsullenly and Kent crept out from his hiding-place and hurried to the house. as he hurried along he muttered: \n\n\n        “I am none the worse off for my little reconnaissance. I have gained a point at least.” he soon reached the house and went to bed. he heard Sowers come in and he soon fell asleep after that. on the following morning he was up pretty early and walked down by the ledge. he saw a piece of paper laying there and he stooped down and picked it up. \n\n\n        thinking it might be of use to him in the future he started to put it in his vest as it looked like a blank piece of paper – he took a second glance at it and he could dimly see marks on there – ink marks, and as he\n\n\n[PAGE 160: SC0313_Ms_152]\n\n\nwas a man of quick decision he soon came to the conclusion that it could be read by holding the paper under water he he accordingly held it under the water “another mystery for me to fathom by Jove!” said he gleefully after he had held the paper under the water a few moments he read the words over and over again, as if trying to get them by heart. finally he rose from the bank of the creek and folding the paper put it in his vest pocket. he then walked on toward the mill muttering satisfactorily to himself: “I am a lucky man as sure as I am alive. my little morning walk has helped me to gain a clue to another little mystery. I’ll see the parties interested in this little by play as soon as I can” he entered the mill exchanged a cordial\n\n\n[PAGE 161: SC0313_Ms_153]\n\n\nwith Hugh. Walters. Then he went into the counting-room as the office was generally called “I will be able to build a new house for my family.” Said he as he took a seat. “It is my duty as well as money in my pocket ‘to unravel all this tangled web. here I have-one-two-three-four- cases to ‘fix” up before I leave the “Sic Semper tyrannis’ state” he smiled and rubbed his hands together gleefully as he spoke. \n\n\n        It was not long before breakfast was ready and he went to the house with Hugh. \n\n\n        “you seem to be in a good humor Mr Kent. What has happened to make you so happy” remarked Hugh half-enquiringly. “You will find out in plenty time I must keep this as a secret for awhile old friend” Said Kent good humoredly yet positively. \n\n\n[PAGE 162: SC0313_Ms_154]\n\n\n“all right sir, I  am willing to abide my time.” answered Hugh readily.\n\n\n        “In the course of time I will say like Shakespeare” Said Kent “I will say to you before a great while [÷] ‘Let me speak How these things came about; So Shall you hear of secret, evil and unnatural acts’”’ \n\n\n        “That is some of Shakespeare’s famous words are they?” asked Hugh.[bw][bx] \n\n\n        “Yes sir” answered Kent “They are some of  his great words”\n        “So you have business to attend this morning” resumed Hugh. \n\n\n        “Yes Business. business” replied Kent, and he resumed after a short pause\n\n\n        “E’en a child might understand\n        The de’il has business on his hand”\n\n\n        “They were at the diningroom door by this time and they at once sat down to \n\n\n[PAGE 163: SC0313_Ms_155]\n\n\nthe table to enjoy the frugal meal. This finished; Kent started off on his privileged horse to look over the country. he took a lunch with him, it looked rather large just to be a lunch but a man is privileged to carry as “big” a lunch as he chooses aint he? of course – Why not that is if he can get it. he was soon lost from sight in the woods. Dr. Maltby came down that morning to see Mattie. he didn’t stay long. he said he would stop again as he came back from Berryville as he had to go down there on business. Kate Barton came up to see Mattie that morning: \n\n\n        “How are you this morning dear Mattie?” was Kate’s first words as she entered the chamber where Mattie was. \n\n\n[PAGE 164: SC0313_Ms_156]\n\n“I am well as can be expected Kate” answered Mattie. She could not speak harsh when she was greeted so lovingly: \n\n\n“How are you Kate?” inquire She after a short pause: \n\n\n“I am well thank you.” replied Kate. \n\n\n“La me I never was sick in my life!”\n\n\nElla was there and she saw it was time to interfere so she said [÷]\n\n\n        “Kate come out here and look at Mattie’s flowers” and when Kate came out of the room Ella said easily: \n\n\n        “Kate I dont want you to refer to that dreadful night. I dont want you to say anything to Mattie about it. The doctor said we must not say any thing to her about it until she gets perfectly well.”\n“no I wont say anything” said Kate. She then returned to then room\n\n\n[Possibly missing p.165]\n\n\n[PAGE 166: SC0313_Ms_158]\n\n\nShe fixed everything for Mattie’s comfort. Mattie got awaked in about half-an-hour’s time. She looke around for her visitor\n\n\n        “Is Kate gone at last?” She asked Ella. \n\n\n        “Yes She has gone and I wish she would stay” replied Ella. “She talked me to Sleep I wish she would stay away from here” Said Mattie. The morning soon slipped away at about one o’clock Dr. Maltby came along. he went in again to see Mattie. \n\n\n        “You will soon be able to go to the Springs” Said he encouragingly. \n\n\n        “hope I will doctor” was the reply. \n\n\n        “how long will it be before she is able?” queried Ella. greatly pleased to hear the remark\n\n\n        “Well about the first of August” said the doctor. “It is not so very soon after all” he added after a short pause. \n\n\n“No I dont think so” replied Ella\n\n\n[PAGE 167: SC0313_Ms_159]\n\n\n“I’ll be glad to get off at that” Said Mattie cheerfully. \n\n\n        “yes we must always thank a kind master for sparing our lives” responded Dr. Maltby. “Thank the Great One” resumed he “for our lives being spared after such protracted illness”\n\n\n        “I always thank him for his mercy” replied Mattie feelingly. \n\n\n        The doctor soon left, for Winchester as he rode along the merry warbling of the birds didn’t attract his attention. \n\n\nhe rode on swiftly thinking of other days he soon arrived at his office. Dick put his horse away and he went in his office and taking a seat he tried to interest himself in reading a book. \n\n\n        While he was sitting there a nother scene was being enacted outside. \n\n\n[PAGE 168: SC0313_Ms_160]\n\n\nam a man came around the corner– apparently an Irishman— and looking up he read: \n\n\n        “Doctor Maltby’s Office” that was the sign which hung over the doctor’s office door. The Irishman (?) entered and said in his richest brogue: \n\n\n        “The top of the afternoon to yees docther how do yees find yersel’?”\n\n\n        “Thank you sir I am well and I dont think you are very sick” answered the doctor\n\n\n“Well I cant say I am” said the Irishman (?) “but to business” resumed he “your name is William Maltby. you had a swateheart and you have lost her. I can give you a clue to here if yer like”\n\n\n        “Can you give me a clue to her? but no I dare not hope. how did you find my name out? never mind tell me about her” The Irishman (?) Thus encouraged went on: \nChapter XV\n\n\n[PAGE 169: SC0313_Ms_161]\n\n\n“Yer Swateheart’s name is Jennie. _____” he called a name which the doctor said was correct. “or at laaste you use ter call her Jennie.

I must kape that to mesel’ as Shure as you’re born”\n\n\n        “What is your name and where did you come from?” inquired the doctor.\n\n\n        “me name? yer may call me Pat. but where I live and what’s me other name I aint agoin to tell. but say docther I asked ye — no I tould ye if ye would hould yer tongue I would make yer happy wid the thought of once more clasping yer only love to yer manly breast. are ye going to be quiet an’ comply with me terms?”\n\n\n[PAGE 170: SC0313_Ms_162]\n\n\n        “Yes, yes I will do anything if you will only tell me of her” pleaded the doctor.\n\n\n        “Thank ye fur yer kindness sir I will proceed at woncet[by][bz]. afther ye went away an’ wasn’t hearn ov fur sumtime aw’ yer gal thought you were ded she married another man an’_____”\n\n\n        “Good gracious! did she marry another man?” cried the doctor in dismay.

Oh take me to her at once for I am dying a slow death from the effects of this suspense I have been in for many long and weary years” groaned the doctor and his face was ashy pale — he was trembling in every muscle.\n\n\n[PAGE 172: SC0313_Ms_164]\n\n\n        “Dont trouble yersel’ she is still a lady — though in reduced circumstances but she is well at present.

Pat said in his native brogue “ye can see her in ‘bout four months at the furthest. I will latch over her an’ by the help o’ the Holy Catholic Church, an’ the Blessed Vargin m Mary I will see that she is well cared for”\n\n\n        “Do so my good fellow and I will repay you a thousand times for your trouble — but you have not answered my question when shall I\n\n\n[PAGE 173: SC0313_Ms_165]\n\n\nsee her?” asked the doctor again forgetting in his anxiety that he had asked the same question before. “I tould ye, ye Should see her in about four months an’ I will not go back on me word” said the Irishman imperatively:\n\n\n        “Was her husband kind to her?”\n\n\n        “no the spalpeen was mean — very mean to the beautiful little guardian angel”\n\n\n        “Oh why did I leave her? Why didn’t I take my chances for fortune just so as I made sure of her. but let me ever get her in my sight again and nothing but death shall separate us!” Said the doctor as if talking to himself.\n\n\n        “your leavin’ on her didn’t hurt but that spalpeen comin’ in an’ marryin’ of her is what made yer cakes all dough — never yer mind I will make it all right with her for ye”\n\n\n[PAGE 174: SC0313_Ms_166]\n\n\n        “What was his name?” inquired the doctor the Irishman whispered a name in his ear.\n\n\n        “Him — him oh my God — he was the last one I thought she would have married:” groaned Dr Maltby bitterly [÷]\n\n\n“Dont fret dear sur.

I am thinking that they couldn’t have sent him for a longer term” said the son of Erin sarcastically.\n\n\n        “No I reckon not” said Doctor Maltby. They were now at the Depot and they went\n\n\n[PAGE 179: SC0313_Ms_171]\n\n\ninto the reception-room there and stayed for some time talking about different things.\n\n\n        “I am in luck – better luck than I anticipated I didn’t think he’d believe me” said the son of the Emerald.

I got it when I first came in” replied Pat. in vain did the doctor try to get a look at the ticket he could not for the Irishman took care to keep him from doing so.\n\n\n        They went into the car and took a\n\n\n[PAGE 180: SC0313_Ms_172]\n\n\nseat — they conversed on different subjects until the train started — the doctor then bid his New new found friend fare well and tried for the last time to get at a look at that ticket but “Irishy” was too sharp for him. he watched the train out of sight then he turned and walked slowly toward his office. muttering as he went along “I know them eyes oh how I wish I could have found out where he lives! I would follow him to the end of the earth to find her”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n[PAGE 181: SC0313_Ms_173]\n\n\n        Dr. Maltby went to his office again but he didn’t stay long he went out to visit some patients. \n\n\nThe week soon passed away. and on Sunday May the sixth Dr. Maltby went out to see Mattie Sowers. he stayed longer this particular Sunday than usual. \n\n\n        He had a long talk with Mr. Sowers and while they were talking together Wilse Reed went down to Mrs. Barton’s to have a talk with her. \n\n\n        “Jane wont you release me? wont you let me go away without any trouble?” was Wilse Read’s first words “I wont trouble Sowers please let me go”\n\n\n        “I will not consent” said she  “you shall not go for as soon as you get away you will send some one upon Sowers”\n\n\n[PAGE 182: SC0313_Ms_174]\n\n\n        “no indeed I will not.” said Wilse solemnly. I will go and you will never see me any more. I will go to banada[cb][cc]”\n\n\n        “you wont go anywhere sir. I say you wont go anywhere without my consent” retorted Mrs. Barton David Kent was crouched in some underbrush not far away and he was listening to this little dillemma[cd]. how he chuckled to himself as he heard those two persons say some words which we will record hereafter. \n\n\n        “I am going to wind things up now soon”  said he “and I will certainly have fun I will have my revenge for a little insult— no a little assault I received some years ago. my revenge is duty” added he. \n\n\n        “Jane dont you reccollect[ce] you—”resumed Wilse “dont you reccollect[cf] you are—”\n\n\n        “Wilse Reed if you had finished that sentence I would have wound up up this business at\n\n\n[PAGE 183: SC0313_Ms_175]\n\n\nonce . you started it twice and didn’t end it and it is well you did not!” Snapped Mrs. Barton angrily. \n\n\n        “well I wanted to remind you of it.” said wilse trying to laugh. \n\n\n        “I think of it often enough so dont keep telling me of one thing” responded the Lady.\n\n\n        “you know it is just as well to jog your memory a little once in a while” said Wilse. \n\n\n        “There is the door — — go and dont you ever show your face here again!” said Mrs. Barton. her words angered Wilse and he got up from his chair, raised it and was about to deal her a stunning blow when she cried out: “Help! help! Wont some one save me from the fury of this desperate man?”\n\n\n“Yes” and the speaker who was none other than David. Kent. strode hastily into the room\n\n\n[PAGE 184: SC0313_Ms_176]\n\n\n        “Old man” said he addressing Wilse Reed. “Old man I’d like to know what all this means ain’t you ashamed of your self?”\n\n\n        “No I am not” the words came sullenly from Wilse Reed’s lips. \n\n\n        “Please take him away sir!” pleaded Mrs. Barton. “It is a mercy that you were so near for I believe he would have murdered me”\n\n\n“I’ll take him to the jail for his dastardly behavior” said Kent. \n\n\n“no sir please dont have him taken to jail only make him leave” said Mrs. Barton. \n\n\n“Well it is just as you say but the mean trick I caught him in deserves capital punishment” then turning to Wilse he said in a voice of command: \n\n\n        “I command you to leave this house.”\n\n\n        Wilse.

Then Kent turned to Mrs. Barton. and asked [÷]\n\n\n[PAGE 185: SC0313_Ms_177]\n        “How came he to attempt such a thing as beating you?” Mrs. Barton seemed a little embarrassed finally she said: \n        “I told him to leave here and I suppose it made him mad but dont say any more please sir.” If any one had looked closely in Kent’s face they would have seen large tears in his eyes. \n\n\n        “I hope you will forgive me but I did eavesdropped you and heard all your cons conversation so dont try to get off”\n\n\n        “Oh sir dont tell anyone of our conversation please dont. I forgive you for it is your right since you are a detective”\n\n\n        “I wont tell anyone until you say so.” replied the detective. \n\n\n        “Thank you sir I know he is a bad man but I dont him exposed yet”\n\n\n[PAGE 186: SC0313_Ms_178]\n\n\n        Kent took a seat and had a long talk with Mrs. Barton. \n\n\n        “Well I will call again Mrs. Barton.” said Kent as he rose to go. \n\n\n        “Yes sir do so and I shall tell you more of my history. call again— soon”\n\n\n        Kent bid her good evening and walked slowly toward the house. arriving there he found Dr. Maltby just getting ready to go. \n\n\n        “Doctor I will take a ride with you if you have no objections” said Kent. \n\n\n        “all right Mr Kent I have no objections I assure you. get in and make yourself easy” responded the doctor hospitably:  \nThey rode along very slowly conversing as they went upon different subjects. \n\n\n        Kent stayed in Winchester until about sunset then he went home. \n\n\n        It was a very dull times and the month\n\n\n[PAGE 187: SC0313_Ms_179]\n\n\nMay soon skipped away. \n\n\nMattie.

Reed there, you must have been mistaken” replied Sowers. his words irritated Wilse: \n\n\n        “Well I want the money so as I can go away from here” said Wilse \n\n\n        “you wont get any five thousand dollars from me I can tell you” respond sowers positively thoug[cg] he trembled in every limb. \n\n\n[PAGE 188: SC0313_Ms_180]\n        “I wont? well you may bid farewell to society for I am going to tell Kent” said Wilse triumphantly. \n\n\n        “look here Wilse you was as much implicated in that as I was”\n\n\n        “no I was not for you hired me to do what I did so dont fool yourself I have got you”\n\n\n        “you had better hold on to me then but I wouldn’t give you the amount of money you want if you had kept a thousand secrets. you cant do anything at all”\n\n\n        “I can’t well we will see I tell you we shall see who comes out conqueror”\n\n\n        “Wilse you have threatened me so much and never carried out your threats that I dont care that much for you”\n\n\n        said Sowers snapping his fingers. \n        \n        “you dont, dont you? well I will see that my threats will do if carried out”\n\n\n[PAGE 189: SC0313_Ms_181]\n\n\n        “If carried out” said Sowers with a smile of contempt. “carry them out if you dare. you ugly rascal, I have given you your  last money except your wages. I was a fool for giving you any money at all.”\n\n\n        “Sowers. let me tell you something” said Wilse “before another four months shall pass you shall be exposed, now take notice of my words– They shall come true”\n\n\n        “Let ‘em come Wilse let ‘em come I see you have postponed it you old scamp”\n\n\n        “I have no more to say Sowers I am done talking.” said Wilse. \n\n\nWilse had told the truth for once. for before another four months would pass all was destined to be cleared up.\n\n\nSowers disdaining any more conversation with Wilse, returned to his house\n\n\n[PAGE 190: SC0313_Ms_182]\n        “Ella I guess that is father I hear coming up stairs” said Mattie as she heard the [crossed out words] familiar footsteps on the stairs. \n\n\n“may I come in” asked a well-known voice\n        “yes come in father” said Mattie. \n\n\n        “how are you now daughter?” inquired Sowers as he took a seat. \n\n\n        “I feel very well today thank you”\n\n\n        “And you want to go to the springs the first of July Eh?”\n\n\n        “yes father we[ch][ci] want to go on that day”\n\n\n        “do you think you can get ready by that time daughter?”\n        \n        “get ready!

I aint going to stay here”  said Sowers. his wife came in and he said: “Mary I suppose you are going to the springs” his wife studied awhile then she said: “no Uncle Mose aint mowing around the spring what did you ask that for?” a loud ringing laugh was all the answer she got: \n\n\n        “Why Joshua” says she again “Uncle Mose aint been here since— I don’t know when”\n\n\n        There was a louder and more lasting laugh this time:  “Mary you are a little hard of hearing” said Sowers after a while. \n\n\n[PAGE 192: SC0313_Ms_184]\n\n\n        “Mary” didn’t answer. \n\n\n        The month soon passed and the morning came for the departure. \n\n\n        David.

He advanced toward it muttering as he went: \n\n\n        “I guess here is a new mystery to clear up. I wonder if it aint Al. King.?”\n\n\n        he walked close up to the body and started back aghast for the face of the man (for such it was) was horribly mashed. \n\n\n        he stooped down and felt the man’s pulse. did it beat? he could not feel it beating\n\n\n        “I’ll save him if I can” was his words as he sat holding the man’s pulse. \n\n\n        “Who can it be?” he muttered\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\n\n[PAGE 193: SC0313_Ms_185]\n\n\nThe morning of the first of July — proved to be a busy one at the Sowers’ mansion. every one had plenty to do.\n\n\n        Dr. Maltby was out there early to give the last necessary orders and precautions to his patient.\n\n\n        “How is Mrs. King doctor?” asked Ella of Doctor. Maltby. in the course of their conversation\n\n\n        “She is well and still living in hopes of hearing of Albert.

I do certainly pity her” said Sowers.\n\n\n        “yes it is a pity she is so hard of hearing.” said Mrs. Barton sympathetically: Mrs. Sowers soon made her appearance.\n\n\n        “Why good morning Mrs. Barton” said she “I hadn’t the least I idea you were here”\n\n\n        “yes ma’am I have been here for about ten or fifteen minutes” answered Mrs. Barton. \n\n\n        “Joshua what were you saying about Barto?” queried she turning to her better half\n\n\n        “Oh Mary I said nothing of Barto” said Sowers as loud as was prudent “I was speaking of Mrs. Barton”\n\n\n        “Oh I understand you now, if you were speaking of Mrs. Barton why didn’t you say so?” said she little thinking of the absurdity of her words.\n\n\n        “I did say so” said Sowers laughing.\n\n\n        “I didn’t hear you” said she.\n\n\n[PAGE 203: SC0313_MS_195]\n\n\n“Well talk to the lady now she has been waiting long enough” said Sowers a little more decisively. Mrs. Sowers then related her plans and gave her directions to Mrs. Barton in full. “See to everything about the house and yard” said Mrs Sowers in conclusion.\n\n\n        “I will ma’am. your directions shall be implicitly obeyed to the very letter” replied Mrs. Barton assuringly:\n\n\n        “I will go up and see if the girls are ready w wont you come up stairs with me Mrs. Barton?” Mrs Barton assented and together they went up stairs to see if the young ladies were ready they were very near ready but not quite. So the two old ladies took seats and made themselves as comfortable as possible until the young ladies should finish their elaborate toilet.\n\n\n[PAGE 204: SC0313_Ms_196]\n\n\n        finally all was finished and they went down to announce the fact that they were ready. about this time Hugh. Walters. came to bid them farewell and Kate came over too to bid them adieu.\n\n\n        In the course of half an hour all the preparations were completed and all they had to do was to speak the parting words to their friend. When they looked up the road and saw four men evidently carrying a stretcher and walking very slow. one of them they recognized to be David. Kent. and they all waited in breathless for silence for the purpose of seeing who was on the stretcher nearer and nearer came the men slowly but surely the[cj] were drawing near the house.\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n[PAGE 205: SC0313_Ms_197]\n\n\n        At last the four men reached the house and deposited their burden on the Porch. and the doctor taking hold of the sheet slowly raised it from the features which it covered. for full five minutes they were all dumbfounded at the sight which met their gaze. when they were able to speak they all said but four words with one accord “It is Albert King!” was all they said Then all was silent for some time. \n\n\n        David Kent was the first to break the painful silence. “we must do all we can to save him” said Kent as he suited action to his word after they had fixed the young man as comfortable as possible the doctor asked:  “Mr Kent. how came you to find him?  give us the details of your morning Adventure as we are all eager to hear it”\n\n\n[PAGE 206: SC0313_Ms_198]\n\n\n        “I will sir with pleasure.” replied Kent. “I rose early this morning thinking I would take a morning down in the Ash hollow and brevity [ck][cl] so as to report to Mr Sowers before he went away, and in walking slowly along I saw this man lying in the edge of the wood. I went up close to him and stooping down I felt his pulse to find out whether he was alive or not. my patience was getting worn out when I felt the pulse quivering faintly, my hopes began to run high then and presently glancing up I saw two of those colored men going through the wood I hailed them and asked them if They would help me with this man. They said they would if their master would let them, I left one of them with this young man and with the other I proceeded direct to his master’s The old man was willing and would have let me have a horse and\n\n\n[PAGE 207: SC0313_Ms_199]\n\n\nwagon but the horses were all out and I concluded I would carry the man on  a stretche stretcher if he would let me have four— no if he would let me have three of his men he consented and we soon constructed a stretcher and put our burden on it we started for Brookland and here we are”\n\n\n        Kent seemed to be glad he was done telling his romantic adventure he then dismissed the three men who helped him carry his burden and turned his attention to the young man to examine his wounds. The doctor dressed his wounds and gave him a dose of medicine which soon brought him to. \n\n\n        he stared around wildly for a while then his eyes seemed to become riveted on Ella. It was easy to see he was ‘out of his mind’ as most people term it\n\n\n[PAGE 208: SC0313_Ms_200]\n\n\n        Kent stood for some time looking on in silence finally he said: \n\n\n        “aren’t you people going on your journey today? if so you had better start” \n\n\n        “we cant go now” replied Sowers “so I will tell Wilse to put the horses away”\n\n\n        So the journey to the Springs was postponed for an indefinite length of time. \n\n\n        The ladies exchanged their traveling costume for something more suitable for the occasion the young man was removed to a comfortable little chamber on the second floor and Dr. Maltby prepared to go. \n\n\n        “I must tell mrs. King must I?” inquired he when ready for his departure. \n\n\n        “no sir you must not” replied Kent. \n\n\n        “not for a few days at least for we are not sure who he is yet, his face is so badly scarred. it’s a good thing they are all\n\n\n[PAGE 209: SC0313_Ms_201]\n\n\nflesh wounds” The doctor pondered awhile then he said: “yes they are all flesh wounds and it is best to do as you say” \n\n\nKent wasn’t a in anyway doubtful of that fact so after a few more words the doctor took his leave for Berryville he said he would stop as he came back on his way home. \n\n\n        “I must save him to ruin him” muttered Kent as soon as he was left alone. \n\n\n        “Who could have done this horrible deed?” was his next words. Ella came into the room to take a look at Kent’s patient\n\n\n        “Well Mr Kent you have found him at last” said Ella “but the question is have you got the right man? are we to rest assured this is our enemy Al King?”\n\n\n        “It begins to look doubtful since you all say it does” admitted Kent. \n\n\n[PAGE 210: SC0313_Ms_202]\n\n\n        “we shall see for certain in a few days”\n\n\n        “yes I guess we will see and know for certain who he is in a few days. I hope so anyhow” assented Kent. \n\n\n        “he was dressed well ‘you bet’ he was” asserted Ella “I hope he may prove his innocence of that stabbing and shooting affair”\n\n\n        “I dont see how he is to do it” muttered Kent. \n\n\n        “The Great one dont give us the power to look into the future Mr. Kent Therefore we cannot tell who is the guilty one yet” Ella. said and her eyes twinkled merrily when she saw she had got the mastery over Kent by bringing in such a powerful argument. Kent admitted her words were plausible\n\n\n        “There is more truth than poetry in your argument” said Kent. \n\n\n         “Isn’t every thing changed? Dont why we were all for the Springs a few minutes ago, now \n\n\n[PAGE 211: SC0313_Ms_203]\n\n\nwe have postponed going until this young man gets well” said Ella enthusiastically. \n\n\n        “I hope he will get well soon” said Kent. “for I have several other cases to attend to as soon as I get through with this one.”\n\n\n        “You dont say so Mr. Kent.” said Ella in astonishment. “Where is the other cases?”\n\n\n        “Yes I do say so I assure you” said Kent. “you will find all out in plenty time”\n\n\n        “You speak in parables Mr. Kent. those days are not days of parables but days of plain speaking” asserted Ella. “so please explain yourself” Kent looked steadily in her lovely face for some moments before he spoke. \n\n\n        “I intend to let events explain themselves when they occur” said he complacently. \n\n\n        “That is your decision is it?” laughed Ella in reply to Kent’s last words. \n\n\n[PAGE 212: SC0313_Ms_204]\n\n\n        “You guessed aright that time” smiled Kent. for he could not help smiling under the influence of one of her quiet smiles. While those two were enjoying a little teté-a-teté together, Mattie was enduring a little tete-a-tete with Kate Barton. \n\n\n        “Dear Mattie” Kate said with a smile that looked demoniac. to Mattie. “Aren’t you very sorry you couldn’t go to the springs today?”\n\n\n        “no I am not very sorry for I always heed the old proverb which says: ‘circumstances after cases’” answered Mattie her red lips slightly curving. “La! Me some people are always taking quotations from ‘The old proverb’” said Kate derisively.  \n\n\n        “Well I guess the old proverbs are as good as the new ones” commented Mattie\n\n\n        “So I reckon” snarled Kate. “I reckon the ancient proverbs are as good as the modern ones”\n\n\n[PAGE 213: SC0313_Ms_205] [last number on page is torn]\n\n\n        “We can talk about something else” said Mattie “I dont see any use in talking of one thing all day”\n\n\n        “you are right that you are Mattie!” said kate “sensible girl that you are!”\n\n\n        Mattie said no more to Kate and that young lady (?) took her departure. “Good-bye Mattie” said she.\n\n\n        Mattie bid her farewell as cordially as she always did. Ella soon came in and told Mattie how the young man was getting. \n\n\n        “He is still delirious. and keep’s muttering just one word that is ‘foiled’” said Ella to her bosom friend– Mattie. \n\n\n        “That is a strange word” said Mattie wonderingly: “Well he is as delirious as you and one word is just as appropriate as another”\n\n\n        “Yes that’s so. you are a great planner Mattie to be sure!” said Ella laughingly. \n\n\n[PAGE 214: SC0313_Ms_206]\n\n\n        The girls had a long talk together. Sowers was very busy at the mill and he had almost forgotten about the young man that was so badly scarred and bruised. \n\n\n        “Oh I almost forgot about the young man, Hugh I must go over and see him” said Sowers suddenly reccollecting[cm] the young man. \n\n\n        “yes sir I would like to hear how he is getting along” said Hugh. “I beleive [cn]I will go over and take a look at him, myself” \n\n\n        So saying they went over to see him. \n\n\n        “How is he now Mr. Kent?” enquired Sowers as he entered the room. \n\n\n        “He is pretty bad off now I can tell you” whispered Kent as he sat there fanning his patient presently he said: \n\n\n        “There seems to be some doubt respecting this man’s identity do you think— can you say positively he is Albert King?”\n\n\n[PAGE 215: SC0313_Ms_207]\n\n\n“well I have had no doubts about it” asserted Sowers dryly as he looked steadily in the young man’s face.\n\n\n        “He doesn’t look exactly like Al. King— yes he does you are only getting me prejudiced against his looks but you can’t do it” resumed Sowers in a low voice. \n\n\n        “I aint trying to prejudice you at all” said Kent. “I am only speaking according to the dictates of conscience”\n\n\n“Well all I have to say is they are enough alike to be two brothers” said Sowers\n\n\n“I mean that, the young man lying there and Al. King are enough alike to be brothers” explained he. \n\n\n        “That is so as much to say this is Al. King. well I hope it is for I am tired out looking for him” said Kent\n\n\n[PAGE 216: SC0313_Ms_208]\n\n\n        Soon after this Sowers and Hugh went back to the mill. Ella came in and said “I will look at his clothes you took them all off did you not?”\n\n\n        “Yes miss. There they are” said Kent. \n\n\n        Ella took them down and examined Them closely. pants coat and vest. Then she took the shirt and began examining it she looked at it for some time. \n\n\n        all at once she gave one loud scream and fell from her chair to the floor insensible.\n\n\nWhat she saw that caused her to faint we must reserve for another chapter\n\n\nThen we will tell.  \nChapter XIX\n\n\n[PAGE 217: SC0313_Ms_209]\n\n\n        Ella had scarcely fallen on the floor before every member of the Sowers family were in the room. every one asking the same question “What is the matter?” they said all in a breath. Kent didn’t answer for the simple [co]that he could not; he was wondering what was the matter with Ella, but he could form no definite idea what was the matter, so he raised her from the floor and carried her to a sofa and laid her down as tenderly as he would have a child.\n\n\n        “I am puzzled my friends” said he after fixing Ella as comfortable as possible. “I cant think for my life what caused her to faint, she was looking over the clothes which belonged to this young man and all at once she gave a scream and fell on the floor before I could catch her” while he was saying this he was bathing Ella’s face with cold water. Mattie proposed to take his place and he complied with her request immediately, saying as he do so.\n\n\n[PAGE 218: SC0313_Ms_210]\n\n\n        “I wish some of you would take a look at that shirt, and see if you can solve the mystery for it beat’s all I ever saw”\n\n\n        Ms. Sowers. accordingly took the shirt and looked closely all over it as she thought and finally gave it up as a bad ‘job’ Ella soon came to consciousness again, she looked wildly around and said hurriedly: “Oh! the shirt the shirt poor Willie dear Willie oh! It will kill me!” She sank again into unconsciousness. Mattie renewed her efforts to bring her to consciousness but her efforts seemed to be of no avail whatever.\n\n\n        Kent left the room. so did the other portion of the family. “Mr. Sowers it seems to me your house is illfated” said Kent when he and his host were seated in the summer parlor, Sowers gave a start when he heard the words:\n\n\n        “It does seem so Mr. Kent” answered Sowers. repressing with a quick and strong effort the agitation he had shown:\n\n\n        “Well Mr. Sowers come let us go into your private office and talk as I have something\n\n\n[PAGE 219: SC0313_Ms_211]\n\n\nof minute importance to communicate to you” said Kent. more for the purpose of seeing what effect his words would have than any thing else, for Jack had told him that no one but sowers ever crossed the threshold of private office.\n\n\n        “No sir you cant go in there” said Sowers imperatively: “I dont allow any one to go in there but my self so if you have anything of importance to communicate to me, you are at liberty to communicate it to me right here.” Kent looked at him furtively for sometime finally he said decisively: “I will not tell you here, if we cant repair to your office the communication shall not be revealed, that is my decision”\n\n\n        It was Sowers’ turn now to eye Kent furtively at last he spoke: “I am willing to go out in the wood” said he “anywhere at all except to my office”\n\n\n        “all right sir do as you please” said Kent. but allow me to say Mr. Sowers I am not\n\n\n[PAGE 220: SC0313_Ms_212]\n\n\na man that will accede to any other persons wishes whatever in a case like this”\n\n\n        “Well Kent we are both the same kind of men when I say anything I mean it” said Sowers positively “and more” added he: “I wouldn’t let anyone come into my private office, I dont care what their mission might be”\n\n\n        So saying he rose and stalked out of the room. Kent went up stairs again to see his patient for he was as attentive to the unfortunate young man as he would have been to a relative, he was a man that would always cling to duty no difference what befell him in his courageous attempts.\n\n\n        The ladies had removed Ella to Mattie’s room where she still lay unconscious. The young man slowly opened his eyes and riveted them on Kent as the last named took a seat by the bed.\n\n\n        “Albert. King!” said Kent loudly. but there was no sign of comprehension on the young man’s face the detective continued to doubt the young man’s identity more and more.\n\n\n[PAGE 221: SC0313_Ms_213]\n\n\nhe held the sick man’s hand in his own for a long while, his thoughts turned to Sowers and the latter’s private office.\n\n\n        “If I could only get in there I would bring everything to a crisis at once” muttered Kent thoughtfully: “I am certain that private office holds a secret and I say the secret which it holds must and shall be disclosed. or my name isn’t David. Kent.”\n\n\n        Kent was a man of his word when he said anything ‘must and shall be done” he meant it.\n\n\n        He sat there thinking and manuevering for a considerable time finally he rose and went to Mattie’s room and gave a slight tap on the door. Mattie came to the door in answer to the summons.\n\n\n        “It is you is it Mr. Kent? Come right in” said Mattie cordially. Ella stirred again for the first time since her second unconsciousness she opened her eyes and stared around then she said:\n\n\n        “Oh yes I remember it all now poor Willie!”\n\n\n[PAGE 222: SC0313_Ms_214]\n\n\n        She turned her face toward the wall like Hezekiah King of Israel she didn’t want to see the light of the world while she was in trouble. she cried herself to sleep. Mattie’s attempts to get her to say something were all of no avail.\n\n\n        When she had gone to sleep they all left the room, Mattie went over with Kent to see that individual’s patient.\n\n\n        “could you not get her to tell you what had happened?” queried Kent when they were seated in the sick man’s chamber.\n\n\n        “Not a word she only says ‘poor Willie’ and something about the shirt” replied Mattie\n\n\n        “I wish Dr. Maltby was here now” asserted Kent “It seems as if there is nothing but sickness here, perhaps the great one is visiting the—” he did not finish his sentence but rose and began putting the room in order.\n\n\n        “Why Mr. Kent you are as handy as a woman in fixing the room up” said Mattie appreciatingly \n\n\n        “Yes I beleive I am as comptent as a woman in doing such work,” replied Kent.\n\n\n        “It is best for a person to make themselves useful”\n\n\n[PAGE 223: SC0313_Ms_215]\n\n\n        “Yes it is to be sure” smiled Mattie as she rose to go to her room. Herbert. Armstead was at the mill with his old friend Hugh. Herbert had come over just as Hugh reached the mill after his last w visit to the house.\n\n\n        “Well old boy how are you?” said Herbert gaily as he alighted and secured his horse to a tree. “I am well Bertie how are you?” answered Hugh in a pleasant voice.\n\n\n“First-rate. I suppose they have gone ere this?” Herbert was alluding to his sister and the Sowers’ family.\n\n\n“Well I dont suppose they are. So we differ in that particular supposition“\n\n\n“Why what is the reason they didn’t go? They said they were going this morning”\n\n\n“Friend Bertie circumstances alter cases always so according to circumstances they were compelled to postpone their journey for an indefinite length of time”\n\n\n“Oh dont trifle so Hugh tell me what was the reason they didn’t go as they said”\n\n\n[PAGE 224: SC0313_Ms_216]\n\n\n        “The simple reason was this; they or at least Kent found Al. King” replied Hugh\n\n\n        “Yes and I will thrash him as soon as I can get a chance!” decided Herbert.\n\n\n        “Oh he is thrashed enough now someone caught him in Ash. hollow and beat him black and blue, that is the truth”\n\n\n        “you don’t say so, well I must forgive him. for what he has done to me — not to me personally but I would as lief he would do me an injury as to threaten my sister”\n\n\n        “Well Herbert let’s go over and see him, I haven’t been long away but I will be willing to conduct your corporeal system over the space of ground intervening between here and his palatial couch” said H Hugh sarcastically. and he lead the way over to the house he was just coming up the stairs as Mattie went into Ella’s room. They went to the bed-side and looked long earnest and solemnly at the scarred face the unfortunate man gazed only at vacancy for he was in a raging fever Herbert’s heart relented at the sight.\n\n\n[PAGE 225: SC0313_Ms_217]\n\n\n        “Albert dont you know me?” said he kindly, then turning to Kent he said: “Why Mr. Kent you were lucky in finding him, please give me the details of the case”\n\n\n        Kent related the details in as few words as possible, at the conclusion Herbert said “you had quite a romantic adventure”\n\n\n        Kent said in his usual positive voice “I was romantic perhaps but very impressive as well, dont you think so Mr. Armstead?”\n\n\n        “I do indeed sir” replied Herbert earnestly\n\n\n        “Have you you seen your sister yet? she is in a very precarious condition” asked Kent.\n\n\n        “No I have not seen her where is she? What is the matter with her?” said Herbert anxiously.\n\n\n        “She is in Miss Mattie’s room, but what the matter is, is more than any of us can tell” replied Kent. Herbert went to the door and asked for admission he was admitted and he went up to the bed-side and called out: “sister dear sister what is the matter? wont you speak to me I am Herbert”\n\n\n[PAGE 226: SC0313_Ms_218]\n\n\n        She turned over at the sound of his voice “Herbert dear brother is it you?” said she in a voice that trembled with emotion.\n\n\n        “yes dear sister it is me your own dear brother Herbert” said he passionately as he drew her little form to his manly breast for he loved her dearly — she was the only one of the gentler sex that he loved as well as his mother. His love was strong for his sister. he would have willingly faced death for her sake.\n\n\n        “Oh dear brother I am so sorry! poor Willie!” she broke out again passionately.\n\n\n        “What is the matter with Willie? I hope he is all right dear sister dont fret, you dont know how your tears pain me — every tear pains me — it pains me to see them fall” and he drew her still closer to him, they were emblematical of lovers which novelists rave about. but it was brotherly and sisterly love with those two.\n        \n        She seemed more calm while resting in her brother’s arms than when lying on the bed. Herbert carried her to a chair and sat down with her on on his lap.\n\n\n[PAGE 227: SC0313_Ms_219]\n\n\n        “Miss Mattie you will excuse me for taking such liberties will you not?” queried he as he seated himself in the chair alluded to\n\n\n        “certainly Mr. Armstead certainly, I am willing to do any thing for Ella that will be likely to alleviate her trouble” replied Mattie promptly. and Herbert felt his heart flutter for the first time. They were all seated now and Herbert began. talking again:\n\n\n        “What do you mean sister by saying ‘poor Willie’? have you heard from him yet?” inquired Bertie in a soothing voice.\n\n\n        “I cant tell you oh was it a dream or was it reality?” groaned she and Mattie interfered.\n\n\n        “dont ask her Bertie — I mean Mr. Armstead dont dont ask her please or she might faint again” said Mattie in a low sweet voice.\n\n\n        “Well I wont ask her any thing more” assented Herbert “but I will ask you to call me Bertie as a favor wont you?” and he looked lovingly at her.\n\n\n        “I will if you wish it as af a favor”\n\n\n[PAGE 228: SC0313_Ms_220]\n\n\nreplied Mattie a little bashfully.\n\n\n        “Thank you Miss Mattie for your kindness” asserted Herbert earnestly.\n\n\n        Ella disengaged herself from her brother’s strong arms and said trembling tremulously “Come with me I will show you what was that I saw and what made me faint”\n\n\n        she led the way the other two person fast followed behind. She went into the sick man’s room and looked about until she found the shirt which she had been looking at when she fainted. she held up the shirt and beckoned Kent, Mattie and Herbert to her side. \n\n\n        As they stopped close by her side she pointed to a certain part of the shirt and said in a hollow voice the one word:\n        “Look!”[cp][cq][cr]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\n\n[Page 229: SC0313_Ms_221]\n\n\nWhen Sowers strode out of the parlor and left Kent so unceremoniously he went to the stable to see Wilse again. \n\n\n        He couldn’t stay away from Wilse no way he could plan, and so there is where the old adage ‘birds of a feather flock together.’ comes true. although Wilse was considered by everybody too low-bred a person to be a companion to Sowers, if they had known what a nefarious scheme he had been engaged in several years before the opening of our story they would have spurned him from them but society only looks at one side of the picture if you act as a gentleman or lady in society you are at once taken as a true gentleman or lady They never look at the other side of the picture or a great many would be found inefficient to fill their respective places in society. \n\n\nSowers had repented his evil deed— so he said and yet he was ashamed to own it. \n\n\n        He would lie before he would tell of what\n\n\n[PAGE 230: SC0313_Ms_222]\n\n\nhe had done years ago. He wasn’t brave enough to divulge a secret he had kept for years, and years, he had told no one— no one knew of his secret but the man who called himself Wilse Reed— at least he thought so but a nemesis was on his track and in a few months more his secret was to be divulged to be divulged in the presence of the very persons he did not wish to hear it. \n\n\n        Anyone would have thought he would have been a better man after seeing him kneel at the bedside of his daughter and call out to the Great. One. to spare his child—his only child— she had been spared to him and still he would not turn from his evil ways and try to lead a better life. a life clean of all secrets clear of all hidden sin he could not bear the idea of being degraded in the sight of his fellow-men. Oh if he had only divulged his secret what a load he would have lifted from a gentle mother’s heart— but no he must keep his secret he thought and Wilse? as for Wilse he was satisfied he would never tell. \n\n\n[PAGE 231: SC0313_Ms_223]\n        \n        “Wilse we didn’t get off after all” said Sowers as he seated himself near Wilse in the large haymow. \n\n\n        “No sir I see you didn’t” said Wilse “that prying detective will keep you here all the summer if possible”\n\n\n        “Yes he never could find Al King until were were ready to start on our journey” replied Sowers in his usual tone. \n\n\n        “Mr. Sowers, mark my words that very same David. Kent. is going to make trouble at Brookland” said Wilse positively. \n        \n        “Do you really think Kent will bring trouble on the inhabitants of Brookland? if so I will try to get him away” was Sowers’ question and comment. \n\n\n        “I do really think so indeed I do” replied Wilse: “and more, I think he has a slight clue to our scheme of years ago”\n\n\n        “Well Wilse he must leave hear[cs] and that very soon” said Sowers tremblingly. “I wont have the dog about here”\n\n\n[PAGE 232: SC0313_Ms_224]\n\n\n        “How will you get him away?” queried Wilse eyeing Sowers furtively \n\n\n        “I will tell him to go that I dont want him any longer and I will make him leave” answered Sowers and he meant more than he said –so did Wilse– Wilse had a good plan in his mind a plan that would exterminate a dozen detectives like Kent or any other man. but he was afraid to trust Sowers so he awaited that gentleman’s good will to name a plan. \n\n\n        But Sowers was as wily as his accomplice he wasn’t going to order any plan until he saw Wilse was determined not to do so his patience died out and he said: \n\n\n        “Now suppose you or I were to drop a little white lead or phosphorus in his coffee or tea –accidentaly of course, what do you think would be the consequence”\n\n\n        Wilse studied awhile and then said\n        “I haven’t the least ideat what the consequence would be do you?”\n\n\n        Sowers looked at Wilse steadily for sometime before he spoke, at last he said\n\n\n[PAGE 233: SC0313_Ms_225]\n\n\n        “Well I aint certain what would be the consequence in such a case”\n\n\n        Wilse smiled a contemptible smile as he commented: “you are a wily dog Sowers but I prove myself more than a match for you if you don’t look sharp”\n\n\n        Sowers shuddered involuntarily at Wilse. Reed’s prophetical words. he saw trouble brewing on life’s uncertain sea, literally speaking. \n\n\n        “Oh Pshaw Wilse you aint anything generally speaking” said Sowers as a hideous smile rested on his face. \n\n\n        “I aint anything? aint I though? Well you will and shall see what I am you dont know me you dont know who and what I am” asserted Wilse confidentailly[ct]: \n        \n        “I have known, you for at least twenty years. and I know who and what you are fully” answered Sowers  “but for all I have known you so long I have never known any good of you.” \n\n\n        “yes I have done wrong in letting you run so long” said Wilse tauntingly: “you have known nothing but good of me you old scoundrel!”\n\n\n[PAGE 234: SC0313_Ms_226]\n\n\n        “Easy Wilse easy, dont get desperate” said Sowers “Always take things easy– not so fast be reasonable you dastardly wretch.”\n\n\n        Wilse was exasperated with rage at Sowers’ taunting words he made a desperate lunge at Sowers but Sowers succeeded in getting out of his reach in time to prevent getting struck for Wilse intended dealing him a stunning blow. By Sower’s quick movement Wilse fell sprawling on the floor and his head ^(struck) against a projecting beam with such tremendous force as to knock him senseless for some time. \n\n\n        “Great heavens I beleive[cu] the rascal has killed himself outright” said Sowers in great consternation “I will do all I can for him for I may be suspected of his murder if he dies”\n\n\n        So saying Sowers went down and got some cold water and hurried back to bathe Wilse’s face for death seemed staring him in the face in a hundred ways. \n\n\n        “What if Wilse should died and I be caught bathing his face I would be indicted for\n\n\n[PAGE 235: SC0313_Ms_227]\n\n\non the charge of his murder” said Sowers to himself as he faithfully applied the cold water to Wilse Reed’s face, temples, and wrists. \n\n\n        “Ha! He is coming around at last” thought Sowers triumphantly: “Wilse Wilse come rouse up fellow, dont be laying here what is the matter my man? you were so mad you fainted and fell against that beam”\n\n\nWilse did not answer or show any sign of life except by the beating of his heart\n\n\n        “Why everybody seems to be dying or sick at my house, Kent’s words are strangely prophetical in their real meaning” continued Sowers still doing his best to arouse his accomplice his brows knitting and his face turning pale. “The idea of him wanting to go into my office, why the very idea is preposterous, I’ll have him away from here if I have to pos[cv][cw]ion him!” Sowers voice sank very low as he spoke the last words. his words were strangely suggestive of some mischeif[cx] . and Kent seemed to be implicated. \n\n\n[PAGE 236: SC0313_Ms_228]\n\n\nSowers didn’t relax his efforts until he brought Wilse to consciousness. Wilse slowly opened his eyes and glared at Sowers savagely. \n\n\n        “Wilse you had a very narrow escape from death, that ought to remind you of your wickedness in—” Sowers was cut short in his exhortation to mindfulness of the mercies of Deity by Wilse saying: \n\n\n        “Sowers I dont want any more foolishness you old scoundrel if you think you can silence me by your hypocritical talk, you are thinking wrong –very– wrong”\n\n\n        As Wilse ceased speaking he looked at Sowers again savagely —as savagely as if he would willingly rend him in peices [cy] if it was in his power to do so. \n\n\n        “Let up Wilse and go to the door I think a little air will help steady your nerves.” said Sowers half tauntingly: \n\n\n        “You had better hush your accursed mouth you ugly daredevil!” snapped Wilse. \n\n\n        “I tell you to be easy Wilse, we can settle this without so much bad talk.”\n\n\n[PAGE 237: SC0313_Ms_229]\n\n\nAsserted Sowers in his mildest tones \n\n\n        “Well settle it then.” assented Wilse. “I don’t care what you do”\n\n\n        So they “settled” their little “fuss” in a quiet way, then they talked of other topics. finally Sowers said: \n\n\n        “Kent wanted to go in my office this morning, you know Wilse that I have things in there that no one knows of but you and myself”\n\n\n        “I keep telling you to send Kent away from here” was Wilse’s comment “And if he gets a hold of the things you were saying no one knew of but you and I— he’ll make short of you.”\n\n\n        “Yes he will do that” said Sowers “And he must be sent away some how or other”\n\n\n        “He has found Al. King now and he’ll soon go” asserted Wilse. “For he will be through with his ‘job’ when Al King gets well and appears at court.”\n\n\n        “I dont beleive[cz] it is Al. King. for my part” said Sowers positively: “Kent has made a blunder I think what do you think?”\n\n\n[PAGE 238: SC0313_Ms_230] [page number missing; Page torn]\n\n\n        “Well I don’t know what to say” answered Wilse. “The young man’s face is so badly disfigured that it is hard to identify him.”\n\n\n        Wilse seemed to be a little reserved in regard to the identification of the young man whom Kent had brought to the house on that morning. They were silent for some moments. \n\n\n        finally Sowers said: \n\n\n        “Ella. Armstead had a fainting fit this morning I think we are having plenty sickness”\n\n\n        “What was the cause of her fainting?” asked Wilse, looking a little interested. \n\n\n        “We have not and it seems cannot ascertain the cause” replied sowers. “Kent words keep ringing in in my ears”\n\n\n        “What were his words? I beleive[da] he is getting you bewildered” responded Wilse\n\n\n        “Why he said it seemed as if my house was ill-fated” replied Sowers uneasily. \n\n\n        “He is a downright fool!” said Wilse.  And I’ll tell him so if he bothers me, I’ll put his ‘light’ out as sure as peas are peas[db][dc], if he bothers me I’ll see if I cant slit his accursed Wind-pipe”\n\n\n[PAGE 239: SC0313_Ms_231]\n\n\nSowers shuddered to think of the desperate man he had made his companion. he had been thinking— yes saying he would poision[dd] Kent and yet he shuddered to hear Wilse say he would cut his throat. \n\n\n        Sowers was a man with very little courage our Readers have doubtless already found that out. He would suggest this and reply to that. graphically speaking but he would always always back out when the time came for carry into action his words. \nHe had never had courageous in but one transaction that was when he carried out his terrible plan of revenge by going to the— my pen revolts from the task of writing his awful heart-rending deed. Was it as bad as murder? We shall see. \n\n\n        “Wilse let us both go over to the house” said Sowers as he rose to go “I want to see the young man. Will you go over or not? Yes you had better go and see him”\n\n\n[PAGE 240: SC0313_Ms_232] [page number corrected by Newman from 234 to 240]\n\n\n        “yes I will go over and see him” reluctantly assented Wilse as he preceded his employer out of the stable. They leisurely walked to the house talking as they went. They saw Herbert Armstead and Ella in Mattie’s room \n\n\n        “I wonder what caused him to go in there?” queried Sowers discontentidly[de]. \n\n\n        “Doubtless to see his sister as she is standing very close to him and look she is crying” Wilse ended his answer in an exclamation. \n\n\n        They went up stairs quietly. \n\n\nJust as Sowers opened the door where the young man was he heard Ella’s command “Look” He strode into the middle of the room where the others were standing. Wilse did the same. \n\n\n        They all looked and were greatly amazed at what they saw!\n\n\n\n\n        \nChapter XXI\n[PAGE 241: SC0313_Ms_233]\n\n\nWe, must say a few words in regard to our minor characters — our kitchen characters — what is a kitchen without a cook? or what is a dining-room without a diningroom servant? you simply say that neither are of any use whatever. Well — aunt Sally figured in the first named occupation, and George in the latter, aunt. Sally called herself “one of de ‘ristocratick cooks” and George patronizingly called himself a diningroom servant ‘cut’ out for the aristocracy.\n\n\n        After the thrilling events that occurred that morning the two persons above named went about their duties in the kitchen. Mrs. Sowers presiding, and as usual causing a great many hearty laughs by her comical answers when she didn’t understand what anyone said. However there was no laugh with any of the inhabitants of Brookland on that particular morning.\n\n\n        Everyone was thinking of the strange way in which the supposed Al King was\n\n\n[PAGE 242: SC0313_Ms_234]\n\n\ncaught at last. Aunt Sally studied for a long while before she said anything that morning. formerly she was always ready for talking to Mrs. Sowers or George but she didn’t seem in that kind of a mood now.\n        “Aunt Sally what are you studying about?” inquired George “you have been studying all the morning about someth something”\n\n\n“I’se studyin’ ‘bout de oberwhelmin’ evidence of de power of de Almighty” answered Aunt Sally. “You is neber looking at things in dat way” she added after a short pause.\n\n\n“Where is the overwhelming evidence?” interrogated George “Because Mr. Kent found Mr. King? you call that overwhelming evidence?”\n\n\nAunt Sally disdained making any answers to George, uncle Jack came in and Mrs. Sowers astounded him and Aunt Sally by saying: “Well Jack the boss is talking about selling and taking and Aunt Sally to New England, when you get there you will be free, I am glad he is going just because you two will be set free. and we’ll take George if he want’s to go”\n\n\n[PAGE 243: SC0313_Ms_235]\n\n\n“Missus, Missus may god bless you for dat” said Jack fervently as soon as he could speak “But I will neber — no neber leave you intirely”\n\n\n        “Thank you Jack for your devotion to me” said the lady kindly while large tears stood in her eyes, for Jack’s fervent words had moved her heart and tears would come.\n\n\n        “Missus can dat be true dat we are gwine to be free niggahs at last?” inquired Aunt Sally, for she could hardly beleive what she heard.\n\n\n        “Yes Sally it is true and I guess you will not quarrel with anymore about his freedom” answered the lady with a smile\n\n\n        “No missus I will no do so ag’in for I see now how nice ‘tis to be free” said Aunt Sally. “Georg[df] didn’t mind it th though.” Jack was still looking at his mistress. \n\n\n        “Jack you must stop drinking when you are a free man” said the lady as she caught his look. “you must abstain from the use of all alcoholic alcoholic drink whatever for your you will have your living to get\n\n\n[PAGE 244: SC0313_Ms_236]\n\n\nwhen you are free and you must save your money to buy you a house with”\n\n\n        “Missus give one liberty an’ I’ll fight de rest out myself just so as you give me my liberty” said Jack fearing at the time that his Mistress would take back her promise. \n\n\n“You wont go back on your word will you Missus” Aunt Sally asked.\n\n\n        “I go back on my word? No Aunt Sally never” answered the lady assuringly:\n\n\n        “Missus I can’t tell you how much I thank you for your kindness” resumed Jack as soon as the lady had answered Aunt Sally.\n\n\n        “my mouf is too poor a speaker to tell you how much I thank you” added Jack, not thinking of the absurdity of the last words he used, but Mrs. Sowers never laughed a[dg] Jack’s poor way of talking — she rather pitied him for his ignorance.\n\n\n        “Aunt Sally all your prejudice against free niggers has subsided” asserted George. “you have no prejudice against them now have you?” \n\n\nAunt Sally said humbly: “George I hope you’ll forgive me”\n\n\n[PAGE 245: SC0313_Ms_237]\n\n\n        “Oh yes I’ll forgive you if you wont do so anymore” replied George laughingly.\n\n\n        Kate came in to the kitchen about this time and began her talk or prate what ever you choose to call it.\n\n\n        “So they have found Albert King at last he certainly was gone alo a long time” said Kate as she took a seat near Mrs. Sowers. “Well some say it is not Al King” continued Kate, speaking more from conjecture than anything else. No one spoke and she still continued her prate. in this wise.\n\n\n        “first Mattie was sick and as soon as she got well Al King or whoever he is was found and what a coincidence it was that just as you were ready to go they came down the road with him, La! me[dh] but the workings of Providence is strange”\n\n\n        “Kate you would make a good preacher if you didn’t exaggerate so” said George “But you tell so many of those barefaced fibs if you were to preach no one would beleive\n\n\n[PAGE 246: SC0313_Ms_238]\n\n\nwhat you said” added George mischeviously.\n\n\n        “Indeed I do hate niggers they are always too fresh for my use” said Kate looking disgusted “They always put an unfavorable impression on every word you speak. But this world is so wicked it cant stand long” added she prophetically. not thinking she had given George another word to comment upon.\n\n\n        “It is not the world that is wicked” said George. “The world is all right — it is the people in the world.”\n\n\n        Kate was going to give an angry reply, but just as she was going to speak she heard a hissing sound like that of an enormous snake near her she looked to see where it was but could not see it for some time.\n\n\n        Finally she saw not two feet from her a moccasin snake of enormous size. She was so frightened at the sight as to be unable to speak and the snake was putting himself in a more suitable way to make a spring for her she sat still as if spell-bound not moving a muscle — her eyes seemed as if riveted on the snake\n\n\n[PAGE 247: SC0313_Ms_239]\n\n\nMrs. Sowers noticed Kate was sitting very still and she could not account for this sudden stillness of one who always tired her talking, so she called out:\n\n\n        “Kate Kate what makes you sit so still all at once?” No answer came from Kate’s lips she sat as still as if stone dead. “George see what is the matter with her” said Mrs. Sowers fearing Kate was dead.\n\n\n        “Kate Kate come what is the matter?” said George shaking her vehemently. \n\n\n        It was some time before Kate could be aroused from the stupor in to which she had sank. When she did get aroused she said: “Look Look yonder George see that snake?” George looked and was astounded at what he saw for he saw the identical snake which I have described.\n\n\n        He ‘went” for that snake and “gobbled him up in less nor no time” as the old trappers say when the[di] kill a redskin.\n\n\n        Kate didn’t care about about arguing\n\n\n[PAGE 248: SC0313_Ms_240]\n\n\nanymore for that once so she reparied[dj] at once to her home to tell of her adventure or at least of her charm — for the snake had charmed her as some people term it.\n\n\n        “I am glad Kate got a good scare” asserted George ”of course I didn’t want to see her hurt but a good scare will help her maintain her reason or take what little she had got away — it will do which ever is the easiest and I think it would be easier to take the reason she had got away from her than it would be to endow here[dk] with more” Mrs. Sowers thought a little reprimand was necessary so she said kindly: \n\n\n        “George dont you remember the text that the minister preached from yesterday?”\n\n\n        “Yes ma’am It was ‘judge not that ye be not judged, for with the same judgment ye judge with, you shall be judged by’ or some how somehwere near that, that is the sentiment if not the words” replied George.\n\n\n        “Well you said enough of it correct to condemn you,” said the lady “you said K Kate had very little reason and you\n\n\n[PAGE 249: SC0313_Ms_241]\n\n\nmay be judged the same way”\n\n\n        “Oh yes” said Aunt Sally triumphantly. “you got catched at lo last you young free —” She stopped talking for she was just about to say the very word she had promised not to say.\n\n\n        “Aunt Sally you came very near forgetting your promise” asserted Mrs. Sowers.\n\n\n        “yes missus but I didn’t quite forget it” answered Aunt Sally confidentially.\n\n\n        “You must break yourself of that Aunt Sally for it will be bad for you to talk that way in New England.” advised the lady. She was a true lady. a lady in every sense of the word she was one of the few that followed God’s command — went by loving her neighbor as herself by praying for them that despitefully used her she was a christian. one who had never refused those that asked of her, or turned the beggar empty handed away — no poor person in the village of \n\n\n[PAGE 250: SC0313_Ms_242]\n\n\ncou Winchester could be bribed to say a word against her. Her hand had ministered to the wants of every? yes every poor person in the village and indeed she was not entirely unknown in Berryville and vicinity.\n\n\n        “I’ll try to stop it Miss Mary” said Aunt Sally apologetically. and in such a way as to create a laugh for George broke out in a loud hearty laugh.\n\n\n        “Oh yes Aunt Sally will do better after awhile” assented George. after a pause he said, “This is the first of July”\n\n\n        “I thought yestidday was the fust” said Aunt Sally thinking she was correcting a great mistake on George’s part.\n\n\n        “I know yesterday was the first day” replied George “But people call it the first of July for a week yet dont they Miss Mary?”\n\n\n        “Yes it is called the first until near the middle” answered the lady readily.\n\n\n        “Well dat’s another wrinkle in any forehead as sure as you’re born” said Aunt Sally. for it seemed absurd to her that the first of the month could last until near e\n\n\n[PAGE 251: SC0313_Ms_243]\n\n\nthe middle. However she let it go at that and as It was drawing near noon she hastened dinner as much as was prudent.\n\n\n        “George step in and see what time it is” said Mrs. Sowers motioning toward the dining-room door. George disappeared immediately and returned in a few moments.\n\n\n        “It is half past eleven” said he “and I must hurry about my work”\n\n\n        “Yes hurry up Georgie” said Mrs. Sowers who beleived in the sunday school hymn ‘Kind words can never die.’\n\n\n        She always abided by that rule she always said “one kind word will do more good than a thousand unkind ones” and she was right — a kind word will very often save a human life while an unkind word will slay a thousand.\n\n\n[PAGE 252: SC0313_Ms_244]\n\n\nor be the cause ^(cause) of them being slain.\n\n\n        Mrs. Sowers said she would go up and see the young man and also see how Ella was as she had seen Herbert. and Hugh go up stairs and also her husband and Wilson Reed.\n\n\n        She went up stairs directly behind Sowers and Wilse and went into n Mattie’s room then she went to the young man’s room as she found no one in Mattie’s room. as She went in she saw they were all dumbfounded at something they saw so she went up close and looked at the place which Ella pointed out and to her great surprise she saw in her own hand-writing written with indelible ink a name on the shirt — the name was:\n                        “William. G. Reed!”\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\n\n[PAGE 253: SC0313_Ms_245] [Page number corrected from 241 to 253 by Newman]\n\n\n        The silence was painful but it was a continued one. \n\n\n        “That is Willie my own dear Willie!” cried Ella at last breaking the silence and going to the bed she kissed the young man passionately saying between her kisses: \n\n\n        “Oh my own dear Willie how did you get hurt so bad?” no answer came from the young man for he was out of his mind. Kent had to take Ella away from the sick man for she was hugging and kissing him so passionately that it was feared she would hurt some of his wounds\n\n\n        “I was deceived after all” said the baffled Kent “I was sure I had Al King.”\n\n\n        “I had my doubts all the time” responded Sowers “he is so scarred up it would take a keener eye than mine to identify him by his looks”\n\n\n        “The name on the shirt explained all” asserted Mattie speaking for the first time\n\n\n[PAGE 254: SC0313_Ms_246]\n\n\nsince the finding of the name. \n\n\n        “Yes that explains all, poor William!” said Mrs. Sowers “Little did he think when he left that he would be brought back thus”\n\n\n        “Yes my poor son is in a bad fix” said Wilse Reed as he went to the bed. “Son! Son dont you know me? William dont you know me?” The only answer he got was a blank stare. Kent watched Wilse when the latter was speaking to William Reed— for such we must call him since his friends call him by that name— Kent watched Wilse and he saw a hideous smile play upon his features as he bent his head low while talking to his son (?)[dl] Kent noted all of this. \n\n\n        “I can never forgive myself for my careless words this morning” said Ella despairingly: \n\n\n        “What were your words Ella?” queried Mattie. \n\n\n        “Why I told Dr. Maltby I would be so glad to see Willie come down the road this morning, and I am sure I didn’t want to see him carried, I was wishing to see him hale and heart but to my great sorrow he has been beaten by robbers and is \n\n\n[PAGE 255: SC0313_Ms_247]\n\n\nnearly dead, Oh Mattie I will go mad!”\n\n\n“dont cry dear Ella dont cry” said Mattie soothingly: “You meant no harm by saying what you did, and you must be thankful he is no worse— be thankful he is living and you are able to attend him”\n\n\n        Mattie’s words caused Ella[dm] old courage to come back to her in all it’s force. \n\n\n        “Thank you dear Mattie for your encouraging words” said Ella as she shook her friend’s hand warmly: “I will be thankful and hope for the best” added Ella courageously: \n\n\n        “Well I must go good-bye friends–good–bye Ella” said Herbert as he started from the room he gave his sister a kiss and said: “do all you can for him Ella and hope for the best— don’t be discouraged”\n\n\n        “I will do my best brother give my love to mother and father and tell them I don’t know when I will come home”\n\n\n        “all right I will do so and I’ll come over here tomorrow to see you”\n\n\n[PAGE 256: SC0313_Ms_248]\n\n\nSo saying he and Hugh went over to the mill talking as they went– of the startling sensation they had just witnessed: \n        “you didn’t give Al. King a thrashing” affirmed Hugh “you didn’t think of it did you? or are you going to wait until he can stand a good thrashing?”\n\n\n        “I’ll have to wait until he is found that is what I will do” responded Herbert dryly. \n\n\n        All of the people left Willie’s room except Ella and Kent. \n\n\n        Ella said she was going to stay with the young man until he got well. An hour passed. dinner was announced. and all appeared promptly for it soon ended. The sick man was still raging with fever. At about three o’clock the doctor came to see his new patient he was startled to hear of him being changed from Albert King to William Reed. \n\n\n        He stayed for a considerable time and as is always the case he was asked some questions about his relations— Ella asked him whether he had a sister or brother\n\n\n[PAGE 257: SC0313_Ms_249]\n\n\nAnd he replied in a voice suddenly filled with emotion: “I had a sister when I left home but whether she is living or not I am not able to say, but I hope she lives”\n\n\n        “Yes she may be living yet for all you know” commented Ella; “you may meet her again before you die”\n\n\n        “If I could only hope such a thing” said the doctor feelingly: “if I could only hope to meet her again my cup of joy would be filled to over-flowing”\n\n\n        “well doctor when do you suppose my dear Willie will be able to go to the Springs?  for he will have to go now”\n\n\n        “I hardly know when Ella but I think not before the first of September”\n\n\n        “I will be glad if he can go then and stay a month, for it will soon bring his health back to him” \n\n\n        “Oh yes I dont think his health will be very greatly impaired nohow for he always was a strong healthy young man”\n\n\n[PAGE 258: SC0313_Ms_250]\n\n\n        “I never was more baffled in my life”\n        \nThis was Kent speaking to Dr. Maltby for he was in the room too “no sir I never was baffled in my life before this time and I would still hold out that this is Al. King if there were not so many persons to differ with.” “They must know for they have seen both and so have I — and the name explains everything that there is to explain”\n\n\n        “You are right there doctor for his other clothes is marked as well as the shirt. he mu must have been a prudent young man and a careful one”\n\n\n        “I think he will recover rapidly if he is well attended– I cant tell exactly at present but I will tell in a few days”\n\n\n        “Doctor I know you will do all you can” said Ella taking up the conversation. \n\n\n        “And I will never know how to thank you when he gets well which I hope will be soon for it pains me to see him in such misery— for he must be in misery”\n\n\n        “Miss Ella says she is going to stay constantly near him until he gets well.”\n\n\n[PAGE 259: SC0313_Ms_251]\n\n\nSaid Kent addressing the doctor.\n\n\n        “Yes I said so and I’ll never go back on my word— not as much as I love him”\n\n\n        “Kent she is not ashamed to confess love for him— she tells the truth without a single blush” said the doctor laughingly. \n\n\n        “Yes indeed she often does that and if the old saying is true she has a chance to prove her love for him”\n\n\n        “To what old saying do you allude?” The doctor asked in his usual low tone. \n\n\n        “Oh you know– ‘the course of true love never runs smooth’” answered Kent\n\n\n        “Oh you are just like a lot of prophets indeed you are” exclaimed Ella trying to hide a smile that was creeping on her face. \n\n\n        “Well Mr. Kent tell us something about your family to while away the time” said Doctor Maltby. “I like to hear anyone talk of their family although I have never had one” here the doctor sight sighed. \n        Kent studied awhile and then said\n\n\n[PAGE 260: SC0313_Ms_252]\n\n\n        “I will tell you a story on one condition and no other”\n\n\n        “Name your condition and we will certainly adhere to it” said Ella and the doctor at once. \n\n\n        “My condition is you are not to let any one know anything– you are not to tell your best and most confidential friend until I give you leave do you hear?”\n\n\n         “Yes we heard ever[dn] word you said so go on”\n\n\n        “If you heard I want you to heed”\n\n\n        “Alright Mr. Kent we will heed just so as you tell us a story of your home”\n\n\n        Kent was going to start his story at once but Mattie came in and it was postponed for a while. “how is your patient doctor?” inquired Mattie as she took a seat. \n\n\n        “Well he is pretty sick now– he has a very high fever but I guess it will subside before morning— if it continues until morning look out for the pneumonia brain fever. \n\n\n        “You think he will have the pneumonia brain fever if his fever continues until morning?”\n\n\n        “Yes I will not deceive you I think– yes I know he will have it if his fever\n\n\n[PAGE 261: SC0313_Ms_253]\n\n\ncontinues until tomorrow morning” replied the doctor positively in answer to Ella’s anxious inquiry in regard to the fever. \n\n\n        “Well Miss Mattie you are looking well and as sweet as a peach” resumed the doctor. \n\n\n        “Some of the boys will be coming to see you soon I expect Hugh Walters will be one of them.” A hearty laugh was all the reply he got. Mattie soon left the room and the detective went on with his story. We will give our Readers a copy of it in a more convenient season and in a way they will never dream of hearing it. \n\n\n        For the present we will decline revealing what he had to say. let it suffice for us to say that at the conclusion he said: \n\n\n        “I have a wife and four children to support. I left them in Harlem well provided for and I hear from them often and if I live and keep my health I want to clear up all secrets connected with this place and return home in about two\n\n\n[PAGE 262: SC0313_Ms_254]\n\n\nmonths” The two listeners wished him good speed and also good luck in obtaining a good sum of money for revealing the “Secrets of Brookland” Kent said he would go out again reconnoitering and he soon started off leaving Ella and the doctor with the young man “Well doctor, Kent is a smart man a keen witted man and he is playing a deep game” commented Ella after Kent had left. \n\n\n        “You may well say he is a smart and keen witted man for he is certainly one of the keenest and quietest young men I ever saw” responded the doctor, not taking the trouble to say “the most quiet” for he was studying about something more important than verbs or adverbs. \n\n\n        “I hope he’ll succeed in his undertakings, doctor for he is such a kind man” said Ella. \n\n\n        “I’ll bet he’ll prove a trump in the end of his novel career” was the doctor[do] response. \n        \n        “If he dont I am greatly mistaken”\n\n\n         “Who would have thought of such a dreadful thing as he told us about— some one whose name I need not mention” said Ella wonderingly. \n\n\n        “Well he is a keen man and he has got on\n\n\n[PAGE 263: SC0313_Ms_255]\n\n\nthe right track of the parties concerned” responded the doctor readily. \n\n\n        The sick man began turning restlessly and muttering “foiled! foiled! foiled!” all the time. no one could account for his words for they didn’t take much notice of them as they knew he was out of his natural mind. \n\n\n        The doctor ordered ice put to his burning temples so accordingly a peice[dp] of ice was put in a hog bladder and laid on his temples. It had the desired effect for it soon quieted him and stopped his muttering. \n\n\n        “Well I must be going soon for it is getting late” said the doctor “follow my directions to the dot for if you dont do it I will know directly after I come in the morning”\n\n\n        “All right doctor they shall be followed to the very dot” replied Ella “never fear I shall attend regularly to every direction”\n\n\n        “See that you do for he must be well taken care of or you will lose him and I know you dont want to do that”\n\n\n[PAGE 264: SC0313_Ms_256]\n\n\n        “I will do my best for his welfare doctor” said Ella sa as the doctor went out. \n\n\n        The doctor went quietly down the stairs and after bidding the host and hostess good-day he took his leave as he mounted his horse he said “I will be out early tomorrow morning– until that time Au revior.”\n\n\n        He rode swiftly to Winchester and after seeing his horse attended to he went in and had a little chat with Mrs. King. He came out of her parlor and went down the street a peice[dq] but soon returned to his office he took a seat near the window and taking up a volume of some sort he was going to read some when the door was suddenly darkened by an opaque body of some sort, he glanced and saw to his great joy and surprise the jolly son of Erin who had brought him ne[Page torn; likely missing “ws”] of his love his only love about two months previous he was too overjoyed to speak for some time. \n\n\n        A[dr]\nChapter XXIII\n[PAGE 265: SC0313_Ms_257]\n\n\n“Why how do you do Pat I am so glad to see you” said Doctor Maltby to his visitor as soon as he could find voice. To speak after his sudden surprise.\n\n\n        “I am well docther and hope ye are the same” said Pat. “I guess you are more for hearin of yer swateheart than anything else”\n\n\n        “Yes you bring me news of her dont you?”\n\n\n        “Faith an’ ‘tis news that I bring you of yer own swateheart to be sure it is”\n\n\n        “How was she when you left her?”\n\n\n        “She was parfectly well whin I left her, and I know it She is suffering to see you”\n\n\n        “Well can’t I go to see her now or very soon?”\n\n\n        “No, siree ye can’t see her yet that is sartin but you shall see her shortly”\n\n\n        “Are you sure I shall see her shortly?”\n\n\n        “If ye live ye shall see har before another [Page torn; three?] month rolls away, so be quiet and patient [Page torn; content missing] patient be patient as ye can”\n\n\n[Page torn; content missing] be anything just so ^(as) I can [Page torn; Content missing] more meeting her”\n\n\n[PAGE 266: SC0313_Ms_258]\n\n\n        “If it pleases the saints to spare ye, ye shall see her and marry her” affirmed Pat.\n\n\n        “If so thank heaven thank Heaven!” ejaculated the doctor “Where is she? wont you please tell me?” inquired he after a short pause. Pat looked at him in silence for some moments finally he said:\n\n\n        “I have said I wouldn’t tell ye yet awhile and I’ll be true to me word”\n\n\n        “all right my friend, just as you say”\n\n\n        “Docther you had a sister when you went West and you dont know whether she is living now or not” said Pat half enquiringly:\n\n\n        “Yes I had a sister when I left home and I have never heard of or saw her since I left home” said the doctor sadly.\n\n\n        “Well I can tell something about her if you are willing to hear it docther”\n\n\n        “Willing why of course I would be very glad to hear of my dear sister” responded the doctor and he added “If you can tell me something about her I will pay you well for the information” Pat looked at the “docther[ds] as he called him — again for some time.\n\n\n[PAGE 267 missing][dt][du]\n\n\n[PAGE 268: SC0313_Ms_259]\n\n\n        Struggle for some considerable time — Then the old folks forbid yer sister staying at their house so she had to earn her living sewing for a long while — She at last took sick and the old folks had to take care of her and when she got well the old folks consented to the marriage” Pat stopped for he was out of breath\n\n\n        “Go on please. What came after the marriage?” said the doctor impatiently but speaking kindly;\n\n\n        “Well they got married and lived happy with the old folks for some time finally the ould man retired from business and gave all up in his son’s hands — his son proved to be a smart man and the business flourished so the young man was soon very rich — — richer than the ould man had ever been. Time wore on — the ould man died and the ould woman soon followed. —  I will correct a mistake docther if you please — I said “ouldest son” and I meant “only son” for he had but one child — well the property was all willed to his son and the young man has grown gray — but he still carries on business at the\n\n\n[PAGE 269: SC0313_Ms_260]\n\n\nsame place” Pat was exhausted. \n\n\n        “I am very much obliged for the information you have given me” said the doctor “And as a reward for your information you must take this” as the doctor spoke he handed Pat one hundred dollars in gold but Pat refused it.\n\n\n        “I am not a money hunter docther but I thank you for offering it. — It seems proof that ye belave me story” said Pat “your sister is living and doing well — she has had two clouds to kiver the sunshine of her life — they were in this shape — she greived so much because you were gone and she beleives ye dead — and she lost her first child that greived her too pretty bad — oh my memory is so bad I made anothoer mistake the ould folks had a fine looking daughter and she ran away from home before your sister went to live with them — she was ^(niver) heard of and it is beleived she is dead but I hope she may turn up some day and make glad her brother’s heart — oh it would be a great blessing”\n\n\n[PAGE 270: SC0313_Ms_261]\n\n\n        “yes it would be a great blessing” responded the doctor “your story is certainly interesting and I hope I will soon see my sister and brother-in-law and also my long lost love”\n\n\n        “So you dont doubt my story?” inquired Pat.\n\n\n        “No sir I do not. Well Pat you certainly speak English well for It is very seldom you say ‘ye’ and other words common among the Sons of the Emerald Isle” answered and commented the doctor.\n\n\n        “Yes sir I was schooled in this country that is the reason I speak your language so well” responded Pat pleasantly.\n\n\n        “Where is my sister at present?” inquired the doctor after a slight pause.\n\n\n        “I will have to decline telling you docther at present I do it for the best” replied Pat kindly but positively:\n\n\n        “If it is for the best I am perfectly satisfied. I have hopes of seeing my darling sister once more” responded the doctor.\n\n\n        “I am glad to hear ye say that docther” said Pat “And I bring you face to face with your sister when you least think it”\n\n\n[PAGE 271: SC0313_Ms_262]\n\n\n        “I don’t care how suddenly you bring me face to face with her” said the doctor. “And I suppose” continued he “That you will reconcile my sister’s husband to his sister before you stop” Pat eyes the doctor furtively: “Yes sur” said he “I will try and do that very thing as sure as death”\n\n\n        “What was the man’s name that my sister married?” inquired the doctor.\n\n\n        “Now docther I don’t like to decline telling ye his name but I must do so. It will be all the more surprising when you find all out — and It is no use trying to guess for the very person you guess at would prove to be the wrong person.”\n\n\n        “I am satisfied sir in any way you fix it” responded the doctor.\n\n\n        “Well I must be going for it is five o’clock — or not quite five but very near it I will go as far as Harpers-ferry tonight and the rist of the way tomorrow” said Pat as he rose to go. The doctor walked up to the\n\n\n[Pages 272-75 Missing]\n\n\n[PAGE 276: SC0313_Ms_263]\n\n\n        The day passed away quietly nothing occurred worth recording.\n\n\n        The doctor left the same Si sign for Willie that he left for Mattie when she was sick. Thus: at the end of nine days he was to either get better or worse — there was to be some change.\n\n\n        The nine days soon passed and the change came for the better.\n\n\n        It was a hard struggle but William conquered — the alleged William had a strong constitution.\n\n\nHe recovered very slowly Kent heard him say one day as he sat in his room a moody expression on his face: “Foiled in all my plans By Jingo!”\n\n\n        “Strange words those” thought Kent for he was unobserved “Strange words and I will find out what they mean or die in the attempt”\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV\n[PAGE 277: SC0313_Ms_264]\n\n\n        Time wore on. Kent was determined to find out the meaning of the words spoken by the young man in the solitude of his chamber when he thought no one was near him. \n\n\n        The young man had not said but few words to anyone and It was the universal comment with all the inhabitants of Brookland that the young man was a quiet lunatic– the effects of the severe wounds he had received had disordered his brain. This was a comment, the Reader must not think it anything else. was he a quiet lunatic? We Shall see in the course, of, time. \n\n\n        “William can you tell me something about your adventures in the West?” queried Kent one fine morning in the latter part of July as he sat in the invalid’s room. Kent had always doubted the young man’s identity so he asked the question as a test. \n\n\n[PAGE 278: SC0313_Ms_265]\n\n\n        “Out west? have I been out West?” said William vaguely: \n\n\n        “Yes out West. how did you get along out there?” replied and answered Kent in the same voice. The invalid smiled as he said: \n\n\n        “Oh yes I remember now.  I got along very well out there. and then I took a notion to come home and I got robbed in Ash Hollow— I dont know how I got here.”\n\n\n        “You haven’t given any details at all” said Kent “How came you in Ash Hollow? That wasn’t like coming home”\n\n\n        “I have a very bad headache this morning– –I don’t feel like talking– I will tell you some other time” stammered the young man confusedly and with well affected feeling. He laid down on a lounge that was in the room at his service. Kent was more determined than ever to eavesdrop the young man and find out more than what he knew at that time. accordingly he went out of the room and made his way to another room adjoining the one the young man was in. \n\n\n[PAGE 279: SC0313_Ms_266]\n\n\n        The wall– the partition between the two rooms was made of pine plank, so Kent could hear the least whisper (as it was) in the next room. He looked around in the ^(room) and to his great joy he saw a small hole in the partition where a knot had fallen out— It was a small hole but it suited his purpose to a; T[dv]. \n\n\n        He crept to the hole as noiselessly as a cat, the hole was right behind the lounge on which the young man lay. \n\n\n        Kent took a chair and seated himself near the hole and waited patiently to hear what the young mand[dw] had to say: \n\n\n        He had not long to wait for the young man soon began talking to himself: \n\n\n        “I aint telling that man anything” said the young man. “He wants to find out something about my travels— well It would not do for me to tell him anything— he seems to be a suspicious old scrib anyway— I am William. Reed. I am. Ha! ha! ha!” \n\n\n[PAGE 280: SC0313_Ms_267]\n\n\n        Kent was drinking in every word the invalid said and the invalid’s words incited him to find out more. \n\n\n        “Well my doubts are turning in the way I wish them to turn— they are turning to be well authenticated facts” thought Kent as he smiled satisfactorily: \n\n\n        “I’ll nip the flower in the bud” added he. He didn’t hear the young man say anymore so he went down stairs and from the house he went in the mill. He found Sowers sitting in his office. Sowers gave him a black look as he came entered the office but Kent did not mind that. \n\n\n        “Kent I want you to go away for you are doing no good whatever” was Sowers’ first words. Kent didn’t look a bit surprised at the information. \n\n\n        “I know you want me to go but I am not going until I see those you have wronged— righted. do you hear that?” said Kent. Sowers face blanched as he heard the words— they sounded like\n\n\n[PAGE 281: SC0313_Ms_268]\n\n\na death warrant to him. \n\n\n        “I have wronged no one. So you needn’t trouble yourself” said Sowers bravely “But you must leave here immediately. I wont have you on the place you impudent scoundrel!” added Sowers commandingly: \n\n\n        “I aint going anywhere at all until I accomplish what I came here to accomplish”asserted Kent cooly: “And mind how you talk Sowers– remember I am an officer of the law and I can have you severely dealt with if you attempt to drive me away”\n\n\n        “get out from here or I’ll set the dogs on you, you confounded scoundrel!” Said Sowers exasperated with rage at Kent’s cool words and bold demean demeanor \n\n\n        “Just hold yourself in a man’s place now Sowers and it will be best for you— for if you get me mad I will bring things to a crisis at once– I know a thing or two if you dont keep quiet” said Kent complacently\n\n\n[PAGE 282: SC0313_Ms_269]\n\n\n        Sowers paled still more if it was possible. “Well Kent my words were a little hasty and I beg pardon for saying them— I trust we will be a good friends as ever”\n\n\n        “I am willing I am sure Mr. Sowers – I grant you pardon for your hasty words” asserted Kent readily. as he rose to go out. He started off toward Mrs. Barton’s residence as he walked along he muttered: \n        \n        “Ah my friend Sowers I will have you all right in a few days— or months”\n\n\n        He went to Mrs Barton’s door and tapped— She told him to walk right in– for he was a frequent visitor at the Barton’s. \n\n\n        “How do I find you today madam?” said Kent as he walked into the room” \n\n\n        “Quite well I thank you sir how are you?” said the lady smilingly: \n\n\n        “I am well thank thank you— well isn’t this warm weather?” inquired Kent. \n\n\n        It is indeed sir– I think the heat has been very excessive for the last two or three days” answered the lady “How is your patient today Mr. Kent?” inquired the lady\n\n\n[PAGE 283: SC0313_Ms_270]\n\n\nafter a short pause. \n\n\n        “Well he is pretty bad off yet” answered Kent “Or at least he says he is very weak yet and he’s playing off this morning— he says he has a very bad headache and has lain down”\n\n\n“do you think he is playing of[dx] Mr. Kent?”\n\n\n“I know he is for he didn’t say anything about his headache until I began talking to him about his adventure out West”\n\n\n        “Dont you know Mr. Kent I have never beleived[dy] yet that, that is my William?” \n\n\n        “I dont know hardly what to think– but I know he is not your William”\n\n\n        “Well I always called him my William because he was so kind to me and acted like a son to me– he would obey me in all things Mr Kent”\n\n\n        “If this young man’s wound[dz] would make haste and heal up we would identify him”\n\n\n        “Oh I guess he is William— I think we are prejudiced to our beleif[ea] for no one else doubts his identity– no one but us”\n\n\n[PAGE 284: SC0313_Ms_271]\n\n\n        “That is so” said Kent “but still I dont believe he is William Reed”\n\n\n        “We will not bother ourselves with that question but how are you and Sowers getting along?” answered and inquired Mrs. Barton. \n\n\n        “He drove me away this morning but somehow or other I am not going until I get ready. for I must have some fun before I leave the “Sic Semper Tyrannis” state”\n\n\n        “From what you told me there will be considerable fun before the first of October”\n\n\n        “Mark my words Mrs Barton there will be more fun then, than you imagine” asserted Kent meaningly “Every one of you will be surprised— some will be made happy— — others will be made miserable”\n\n\n        “I’ll be glad when the day comes Mr. Kent make it come as quick as possible for perhaps I may be one that may be made happy” said Mrs. Barton. \n\n\n        “Perhaps you will and perhaps you wont Mrs. Barton. I wont say who will be made happy but I will name one that will be made miserable– very miserable for awh\n\n\n[PAGE 285: SC0313_Ms_272]\n\n\nawhile – It will be Joshua Sowers” \n\n\n        “I am willing to wait until the time comes be it ever so long off” asserted Mrs. Barton. “How are you going to arrange it so as to get all the parties concerned in it together?”\n\n\n        “I will fix all at the appointed time. I have not fixed any definite plans yet” answered Kent as he rose to take his leave. \n\n\n        “Well Mrs. Barton I will bid you good morning” said Kent. \n\n\n        “Good morning sir you must call again soon for your company is always agreeable” smilingly asserted the lady. \n\n\n        Kent took a little reconnaissance before going to the house. He went to the stable and got into the hay mow presently Wilse Reed came in the stable and fed his horses. by the time Wilse had fed his horses and watered them. Sowers came in and taking a seat on one of the feed boxes he accosted Wilse as follows: \n\n\n[PAGE 286: SC0313_Ms_273]\n\n\n        “Wilse did you tell the detective anything about me? if you did I’ll shoot you at once!”\n\n\n        “Shoot then if you want to I dont care for your neck you old puppy you are nothing but a desparado anyway”\n\n\n        “That is not the question— I asked you if you had told Kent anything about me”\n\n\n        “I decline answering your question” said Wilse “And you can shoot me as soon as you like I aint bothered a bit by your threats”\n\n\n        “I’ll carry my threats out so dont fool with me Wilse for you know how hasty I am”\n\n\n        “Be hasty and be d—d” said Wilse hotly. \n\n\n        “You are an impudent scoundrel I’ll declare – well I will ask you kindly did you tell Kent anything about me?”\n\n\n        “no sir I did not– he nor any one else”\n\n\n        “Why you told me you were going to expose me and all this and that and now since I have defied you, you wont tell anyone. Why dont you tell someone Wilse? Oh you are afraid of getting yourself in trouble, Eh?”\n\n\n[PAGE 287: SC0313_Ms_274]\n\n\n“I will tell soon enough to bring you down as low as a dog, you old soft sardine I’ll put you through the furnace of degradation.”\n\n\n“Ha! ha! ha! You’ll put me through the furnace of degradation. Why such words from you are disgusting you old codger!” said Sowers contemptously[eb]: \n\n\n        Kent was peeping over the log in front of him and looking down at Sowers and Wilse laughing to the best advantage for the circumstances – for he could not laugh loud –he would be caught: \n\n\n        “I am getting Sowers nearer and nearer!” thought Kent “I wish I could see in that office of his. I am certain he has some evidence in there of his guilt and treachery he is an old coon he is and old fox gentlemen he knows his business” muttered kent as if he were talking to someone beside himself\n\n\nSowers left the Stable— so did Wilse\n\n\n[PAGE 288: SC0313_Ms_275]\n\n\n        Thus giving Kent a good chance to make his exit He made his exit in a hurry for he had to avail himself of the chance to escape before Wilse came back\n\n\n        Kent went in the stable and got out his horse to take a ride. \n\n\n        He took a ride around through the country and then went to town and came out with the doctor. The time flew fast and before the inhabitants of Brookland half realized it the month of August had nearly slipped away the young man was still an invalid and they were preparing to take him to the Springs. \n        In one week more they were to start They did not dream of the thrilling that was to happen in their midst before they left Brookland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXV\n[Pages 289-91 missing][ec]\n\n\n[PAGE 292: SC0313_Ms_276]\n\n\nmake a bargain? will you take what I have offered you? inquired Hardin[ed].\n\n\n        “I dont know whether to do so or not. I thought I would wait until I came back from the springs before I decided“ answered Sowers undecisively:\n\n\n        “Oh Pshaw! now you can’t talk to me that way I wont listen to it — no indeed — — I want the deed drawn up and I want to pay the money, Monday so make up your mind at once”\n\n\n        “Can’t you give me something more? a few hundred more? you know the place is worth more than you have offered me for I it so make up your mind to pay me more money”\n\n\n        “I’ll give you five hundred dollars more than I first offered you, you know I’ll have the mill to tear down and refit and so forth, so don’t be so very hard on me, I am not rich”\n\n\n        “you are well to do though. Well I guess I will take five hundred dollars more than what you first offered me”\n\n\n[PAGE 293: SC0313_Ms_277]\n\n\n“There is no guess work in this. I want the mill for certain and no guessing about about i it so give me a positive answer.”\n\n\n“Well my positive answer it that we have made the bargain — the bargain is completed I will have the deed made when I come back from the Springs.”\n\n\n“Oh no sir the bargain was for you to make out the deed Monday. you must recollect I am paying my board here every day and I am doing nothing. It is not a bargain unless you do that. Wont you do it as a favor Mr. Sowers?”\n\n\n        “Yes I will do it — I will settle all on Monday and start for the Springs on Tuesday so good-day Mr. Hardin I am in a hurry this morning”\n\n\n        “farewell Mr. Sowers I will see you tomorrow I reckon, as I am coming out to look around” said Hardin as his w visitor rose to take his leave.\n\n\n        “Yes you had better come out tomorrow\n\n\n[PAGE 294: SC0313_Ms_278]\n\n\nand take dinner with me Mr. Hardin” asserted Sowers pleasingly\n\n\n“Thank you I will do so with pleasure” replied Hardin with a broad smile.\n\n\n        Sowers went home and told his wife and the rest of the family of his bargain with Hardin.\n\n\n        “Indeed father I am very glad you have concluded your would sell the place” asserted Mattie “I am tired of w Virginia I don’t know what to do”\n\n\n        Herbert Armstead had fell in love with Mattie and he was paying her his kindest attention. He had said he would never love but Mattie’s pure sweet face and winning ways won him over from his prejudice. He could not withstand her smiles they were enough to make any man love her. The day passed and Sunday came. a bright clear day it was.\n\n\n        Herbert was there bright and early with his buggy to take Mattie to meeting at Greenwood.\n\n\n        All of the people at Sowers’ went to\n\n\n[PAGE 295: SC0313_Ms_279]\n\n\nmeeting that day as it was to be their last Sunday there. William[ee] took Ellen. Herbert took Mattie and the rest of the family went in the family carriage.\n\n\n        Kent and Hugh Walters walked although they could have rode if they wished.\n\n\n        “Well they are not going until Tuesday” said Kent to Hugh as they walked leisurely along. “I hope something may happen so as to keep them a few days longer” continued Kent “For my plans are not quite completed”\n\n\n        “Mr. Kent I had a strange dream last night. I dreamed that a young man came here and said he was William Reed. But we all told him he was an impostor and tried to drive him away” said Hugh as soon as his friend ceased speaking “I awoke before I finished my dream but I think I will see it finished in reality” added Hugh after a short pause. “I hope something will be realized\n\n\n[PAGE 296: SC0313_Ms_280]\n\n\nrealized, for I can tell you I am anxious to see your my children” said Kent earnestly.\n\n\n        They spent the day very profitably by going to church. The night time came and all the inhabitants of Brookland Slumbered and dreamed of various things.\n\n\n        Early on the following morning they were all astir for they were to make their final preparations for their journey to the springs that day.\n\n\n        Herbert was over again that day as he had nothing to do and he loved to spend his idle hours in gazing upon the sweet face of Mattie Sowers. \n\n\n        Soon after breakfast Sowers left home for Winchester he arrived at the Hotel just as Mr. Hardin a[ef] was coming out of the hall door on the porch\n\n\n        “Well I see you are here Mr. Sowers. I could not get out to your house yesterday although it would have afforded me great pleasure to have done so, I had too much business to attend, although\n\n\n[PAGE 297: SC0313_Ms_281]\n\n\nit was Saturday: said Mr. Hardin.\n\n\n        “You are scarcely pardonable my dear sir for you said you would do so with pleasure. I will grant you pardon for this once but I’ll not do so again but let us to business at once” said Sowers. He and Hardin went to the Court. House. and there the deed was drawn up — Hardin paid Sowers the full amount each and they left the Court. House. and started for Brookland.\n\n\n        “I will take dinner with you to-day I guess that will do as well” said Hardin’s as they rode leisurely along the road toward Brookland.\n\n\n        “All right I am satisfied so you can take a meal with us to-day as well” assented Sowers. They soon arrived at the mill and Hardin began his inspection he looked l all through the mill and seemed to be well satisfied with his purchase.\n\n\n[PAGE 298: SC0313_Ms_282]\n\n\n        “You see Mr Sowers I am going to tear this mill down root and branch every bit of it and build me a first-class brick-mill” said Hardin as he sat at the dinner table that day.\n\n\n        “I guess you will. for you are determined to do what y you say you will do” commented Sowers dryly.\n\n\n        The dinner passed off quietly and the evening came Herbert was still there and he intended asking Mattie a question or two that night as she was to go away the next morning\n\n\n        So as soon as the twilight came he asked her to take a walk with him up the lane. She consented and they were soon wending their way along the lane they were walking very slowly Herbert’s heart was in his mouth — he had a whole lot of pretty things to talk about but he was at a loss how to commence.\n\n\n        “Miss Sowers — Mattie — dear Mattie” said he nervously and stopped he could get\n\n\n[PAGE 299: SC0313_Ms_283]\n\n\nno further. So she asked in a timid voice “What is it Bertie?” She expected what it was and had been expecting to heare the words before that time.\n\n\n        “Will you try to love me? a little?” said he, again nervously. “I love you with all the strength of man”\n\n\n        She hung her head in silence for some time presently she said: “Yes I will love you. I do love you already dear dear Bertie”\n\n\n        He clasped her to his breast passionately saying as he did so: “Thank God I have won your heart!” She did not try to release herself from his loving embrace but she nestled her head still closer to his manly heart.\n\n\n        “You will love me always then? and not forget me when you go to the Springs?” he asked anxiously:\n\n\n        “I will love you forever and I will not forget you when I go to the Springs”\n\n\n[PAGE 300: SC0313_Ms_284]\n\n\n        They returned home, both feeling better after their confessions. Herbert sat on the porch with his lady-love until bed-time he then went to the mill he stayed with Hugh at night when he was at Brookland\n\n\n        All of the inhabitants of Brookland slumbered again, some were dreaming pleasant dreams of love. others were slumbering quietly.\n\n\n        Ella lay awake for some time after going to bed — thinking of the next day finally she sank into unconsciousness and when she awoke the morning had come —\n\n\n        She was destined to have a startling adventure that day.\n\n\nChapter XXVI\n\n\n[PAGE 301: SC0313_Ms_285]\n\n\n        It was a clear beautiful morning– such a day as we all like to see when going on a long journey or expecting to go. Ella sprang from her bed with a cry of delight. “Mattie” said she. “Oh Mattie just look out what a beautiful day we will have for our journey to the springs!”\n\n\n        Mattie raised up from her bed and looked out and was delighted at the beautiful appearance of the morn. \n\n\n        “We will go down Ella and take a walk up the lane before breakfast” asserted Mattie as she dressed herself hasitly. They went down and found all in the kitchen astir they took a walk up the road as they had said they would and then they proceeded to dress themselves for the journey they were congratulating themselves upon their good luck in having so fine a morning to start on their journey. They were going to the Rockbridge Alum. Springs. \n\n\n[PAGE 302: SC0313_Ms_286]\n\n\n        “I hope we will get off this time– we were dissapointed the other time said Mattie to Ella. \n\n\n        “Yes I hope we may have good luck this time” responded Ella “Wont Willie and my self have a nice time when we get to the Springs? ah we will, you bet”\n\n\n        “I trust you will” sayd Mattie dryly. \n\n\n        “You talk so dry about it Mattie— but you never were in love and you dont know how pleasant it is to have a love”\n        \n        “Well it may be very pleasant” said Mattie evasively “I hope you will always live happy with Willie”\n\n\n        They went down the stairs and found the two young men on the porch. \n\n\n        William was sitting on a bench just opposite Herbert. So Ella went where William was and took a seat by his side— Mattie followed suit and took a seat beside Herbert— It was a  large porch— William could speak all of his love words to Ella and Herbert could not hear what he said at that distance— Herbert had love words\n\n\n[PAGE 303: SC0313_Ms_287]\n\n\nTo speak to his ladylove so he did not bother after the alleged William. Reed. \n\n\n        “Bertie-dear Bertie I am so glad you have come to see me” said Mattie in a low voice as she took a seat beside him. \n\n\n        “Thank you dear Mattie for your kind-loving words– but let us take a walk up the lane” Said Herbert as he rose to suit action to his words– Mattie consented and they started on their walk up the lane – It was not the lane that Ella and Mattie took a walk in but a lance that lead in a different direction. \n\n\n        “Bertie I do wish we were not going to the Springs– at least I wish I were not going for I would rather be with you”\n\n\n        “Yes dearest I would be glad if something would happen to keep you from going– not anything happen to you my dear but– well just something so as you would not go” said Herbert affectionately. \n\n\n[PAGE 304: SC0313_Ms_288]\n\n\n        They sat down on a log that was laying near the bank of the creek and there they spoke words of love. \n\n\n        In the course of half an hour they returned returned to the house and as breakfast was ready they sat down and ate. \n\n\n        “Well it seems as if you are going away for certain this time” said Hugh Walters as they sat at the breakfast table– he did not speak to anyone in particular but merely made the assertion to anyone that choosed to reply to it. Sowers was the first one to speak when Hugh ceased. \n\n\n        “Yes I beleive we will get off this time” said Sowers “But it is so late in the season it is hardly worth our while going. What do you say to it Mattie?”\n\n\n        Herbert’s heart seemed as if it would jump out of his mouth as he awaited Mattie’s answer hoping Mr Sowers would acquiesce in her decision. \n\n\n        “I don’t want to go father— or I don’t care much about going” stammered Mattie and she cast a “sheep’s eye” at Herbert. \n\n\n[PAGE 305: SC0313_Ms_289]\n\n\n“Well we will go upon account of William’s health. It will do him good to go up there” commented Sowers. Then turning to Wilse he said “Wilson I commend my horses and cattle to your care once more. I hope you will faithfully execute the duties of the office in which you are placed to the best of your ability”\n\n\n        “I promise to faithfully execute the duties of the office of cheif magistrate of the cows and horses to the best of my ability” said Wilse jokingly– would he have been joking if he had known how near retribution was at hand? retribution for all the evil he had done? no he would not we presume. \n\n\n        “Herbert why dont you go to the springs with us?” asked Mrs Sowers. \n\n\n        “I can’t well go for our corn will have to be gotten in and I want to help father all I can for we are going to move to New England this autumn” answered Herbert. \n\n\n[PAGE 306: SC0313_Ms_290]\n\n\n        “I thought your father was going to Washington. has he changed his mind?” inquired Sowers\n\n\n        “Yes sir he has changed his mind and I am glad of it for I want to see my old home in Massachusetts once more” replied Herbert “Are you going to New England again Mr. Sowers?”\n\n\n        “Yes my wife is tired of Virginia and I am going to New England again”\n        \n        “May I inquire what part of New England?” interrogated Herbert. \n\n\n        “Yes I beleive[eg] I will go to Boston” answered Sowers. “I think we may do well there and I certainly do like the City”\n\n\n        “Luck-a-day! We are going to Boston too.” Exclaimed Herbert gleefully\n\n\n        “Well we will start a business there” asserted Sowers “under “In the name of Armstead. Walters. Sowers &ec’”\n\n\n        “Why Walters are you going too?” asked Herbert in surprise. \n\n\n        “Yes father and mother are tired of Virginia and they are preparing now to go East”\n\n\n[PAGE 307: SC0313_Ms_291]\nSaid Hugh “I am tired of this country too”\n\n\n        “Are you for Boston too?” inquired Ella.\n\n\n         “Yes we are for Boston. father thinks he can carry on a better and more extensive business there than he can here” answered Hugh. “I know he can, for boston is a large city while Winchester is only a small town.” added he after a moments pause. \n\n\n        “It is very likely you will do better” said Sowers as he rose from the table– the others followed suit. \n\n\nA. few words will suffice to tellsome-thing about Hugh’s parents we do not intend to bring them as characters in this narrative any more than is necessary.\n\n\nMr. Wilbur. Walters— Hugh’s father was an Extensive dealer in Boots and Shows in the towns of Winchester and Berryville He was pretty well to do if not wealthy He had several sons and daughters Hugh and Annie were the oldest. Hugh thought a great deal of his sister\n\n\n[PAGE 308: SC0313_Ms_292]\n\n\n        She was the only female he had ever loved except his mother and of course his smaller sisters— but he loved this sister dearly– very dearly. We said we would be breif so we will not go back on our word we will turn our attention to the tourists While they are preparing and as “William” seems to be a suspicious character we will follow him as he walks down through the yard studying about something– we let him speak for himself: \n\n\n        “I do not love Ella but I must marry her.” said he. Then thinking of the kindness she as well as others had shown him he said: “I ought to be grateful for what they have done for me and tell them what a part I have been playing and rely upon them for forgiveness. I have been a very bad man in my short life. I can’t bear to play the part I have been playing but I do hate so had to throw myself on their generousity. now they are going to take me to the Springs for my health\n\n\n[PAGE 309: SC0313_Ms_293]\n\n\nI do not deserve such generosity on their part and poor Ella I have made her beleive [eh]I love her and I have exacted a promise from her. must I  keep on in this way? no I must stop it if I do not be forgiven for my evil deeds I must stop”\n\n\n        The young man started toward the house determined to tell what was weighing on his mind— but his resolve failed as he neared the house so he sat down on the porch and watched the progress of the final preperations for their journey. he felt uneasy– very uneasy. Kent came up on the porch and took a seat– oh how patiently he was waiting and watching for something to happen. to keep Sowers and the rest of the family from going away— He was still hoping— his hope clung to him with all the energy of hope when bordering on despair. \n\n\n        “Well sir I see you are in a fair way for going on your long journey” said Kent to\n\n\n[PAGE 310: SC0313_Ms_294]\n\n\nthe young man. \n\n\n        “Yes sir I beleive we will start in a few minutes” replied the young man. \n        \n        Hugh came over to the house in company with Herbert and they went up on the porch and took a seat beside Kent. \n\n\n        “Well Kent you are in despair now I reckon” whispered Hugh in Ken’t ear. \n\n\n        “I’ll hope for the best. It seems to me they will be impeded this time” returned Kent in a whisper to Hugh.\n\n\n        Mr. Kent our tourists have a fine morning for starting on their journey” asserted Herbert “I hope they will meet with no difficulty” added he. \n\n\n        “I do” whispered Kent in Herbert’s ear. \n\n\n        “Yes it would answer your purpose” assented Herbert “I wish you good luck on your project.”\n\n\n        “I want that party to come off before I leave Virginia” said Hugh “And I want to see some fun— such as you were speaking of Mr. Kent. but wouldn’t It– wont it be fun you bet it will”\n\n\n[PAGE 311: SC0313_Ms_295]\n\n\n        “Hugh you are very enthusiastic this morning” asserted Herbert. \n\n\n        “I am indeed and I wish Mr. Kent will be successful in his enterprise”\n\n\n        Further conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the ladies– the ladies announced the fact that they were nearly ready– a wonderful proclamation for some ladies to make– but those ladies only said they were nearly ready– not quite. \n\n\n        “Bertie tell father and mother good-bye for me and tell them I will write soon”\nSaid Ella to her brother as she took a seat near him. “Bertie you look so sad this morning– you look as if your best friend was going away”\n\n\n        “Do I though? well best friend aint any name for it” replied Herbert. his words had a hidden meaning but they did not attract any attention from any of the group but Mattie— she understood what the hidden meaning was. \n\n\n[PAGE 312: SC0313_Ms_296] [Page # missing; torn]\n\n\n        “What time is it Bertie?” inquired Ella “I dont think it is any more than seven” Herbert looked at his time peice. \n\n\n        “It is exactly seven o’clock sister” said he “and I believe Mr. Sowers is quite ready. come on and let us be starting at once”\n\n\n        The ladies and gentlemen likewise went out to the carriage and bid the ladies farewell. Kent was in despair. his last hope was gone. \n\n\n        Sowers started off at driving at a pretty lively gait he had hardly started when looking up he saw a man coming down the lane on horse-back- the man was waving his handkercheif to them.\n\n\n        An oppressive silence reigned supreme until the stranger arrived withing speaking distance. “Why how are you all? I am so glad to see you” said the stranger as he stoppe his horse beside Sowers’ carriage. \n\n\n        “You have the advantage of me” said Sowers “I dont know you.”\nChapter XXVII\n\n\n[PAGE 313: SC0313_Ms_297]\n\n\n“Dont know me? dont know your old — or more proper — dont know your young friend?” asked the stranger looking surprised. “dear Ella knows me I know she does. Oh dearest Ella I hope you have not forgotten me?”\n\n\n        “Forgotten you? Why I dont know as I ever knew you to forget you”\n said Ella “And no gentleman would speak to a lady in the manner you have and you a perfect stranger I am surprised at you sir!”\n\n\n        The stranger put his handkerchief to his eyes to stop the flow of tears.\n\n\n        “So soon forgotten so soon forgotten oh! God oh! God what shall I do? What shall I do?” he muttered as the tears fell from his eyes: “I can tell you what to do young man — you can go away from here as fast as possible you are a wretched lunatic!” said Sowers peremptorily.\n\n\n        “Ella-dearest Ella dont you really know me? must I be discarded in this style?” pleaded the stranger.\n\n\n[PAGE 314: SC0313_Ms_298]\n\n\n        “If you call my sister by that name again I’ll discard you with my fist” said Herbert angrily. “I beleive you to be an impostor trying to make us think you are one of our acquaintances but we are not all fools yet.” added Herbert wrathfully\n\n\n        The young man who had been found in Ash Hollow and proved to be William Reed by the name on his clothes — trembled as a leaf trembles before the wind.\n\n\n        “Indeed I am not an impostor. There is Albert King in the carriage —”\n\n\n        “This is William Reed sir and I command you to leave my premises at once” said Sowers sternly, and cutting the stranger’s sentence short. The stranger looked amazed.\n\n\n        “That William Reed!” said the stranger “Impossible. It cannot be for —”\n        \n        His sentence was again left unfinished by Herbert saying: “You are a lunatic young man, and It is very unfortunate that we have no Lunatic Asylum in the immediate vicinity\n\n\n[PAGE 315: SC0313_Ms_299]\n\n\nor I would willingly escort you to it”\n\n\n        “Herbert I do not deserve this from you. have you really forgotten me?” inquired the stranger. “I dont want to get angry”\n\n\n        “Remember you? forgotten you? no sir I never forget what I recollect” answered Herbert jeeringly “What is your business stranger? have you got a “Patent Post Hole Borer”? or some other some other[ei] useful machine that we cant exist without?”\n\n\n        “I have a heart” said the stranger, and he would have said more but he was compelled to stop, for his words caused a hearty laugh to ring out from all present.\n\n\n        “You say you have a heart, is it a patent one or do you think ye we are solicitors of Patents. and want us to get it patented for you? if that is the case you can go at once” said Hugh “We are not patent agent young man so you had as well take your heart to some other place. I say is it a patent\n\n\n[PAGE 316: SC0313_Ms_300]\n\n\non[ej]?” inquired Hugh with a laugh.\n\n\n        “It is a patient one” answered the stranger. There was another loud laugh from all present except the Ash hollow gentleman, he seemed to be in a quandary since the appearance of the stranger — he never smiled while the others were fairly busting with laughter. his quietness attracted attention from Ella and she turned to him and said lovingly, sweetly:\n\n\n        “What is the matter dear Willie? do you feel bad?” She looked at him inquiringly:\n\n\n        “Yes dear I do feel bad” stammered the young man “I have a bad headache this morning”\n\n\n        “Well we will go and sit on the porch until this patentee gets through with his patent heart” asserted Ella as she and the young man got out of the carriage. Mattie and also her mother “followed suit”\n\n\n        They took seats on the porch and began joking about the young man with the “patent heart” or “patient one”.\n\n\n        “Willie dear what do you think of the new patent?” inquired Ella “do you think it will become a household necessity?”\n\n\n[PAGE 317: SC0313_Ms_301]\n\n\n        “I hardly know what to think” stammered the young man. as ^(he) glanced uneasily at the “stranger” with the ‘patent heart.’\n\n\n        Mrs. Barton came out on the porch as she had been engaged again to keep house while the Sowers family were at the springs.\n\n\n        “What is the row out there?” queried she\n\n\n        “some patent agent or what is he any how? Why they are laughing at him!”\n\n\n        “Why Mrs. Barton he is a man with a patent heart and he wants some of the Brookland gentlemen to be his solicitor” said Mattie “They are having as much fun out of him as they want.”\n\n\n        “Yes they seem to, the way they are laughing. Who is he? and where did he come from?” inquired Mrs. Barton. Kent came up on the porch at this time and Mrs. Sowers asked: “What do you make of him Mr. Kent? is he ra really a lunatic?”\n\n\nKent did not answere immediately — he seemed to be studing[ek] ana an an appropriate\n\n\n[PAGE 318: SC0313_Ms_302]\n\n\nanswer to make before he made one –  \n\n\n        “All I have got to say is that we will have fun here this morning” said Kent significantly after a he had studied an appropriate answer to give. “You will all be astonished I can assure you” added he.\n\n\n        Who is he anyhow? and in what way will we be astonished? do you think he is al Al King?“ Mrs. Sowers asked the three questions all in a breath as she looked Kent in the face with intense interest.\n\n\n        “I will not venture an opinion as yet of for I never jump at conclusions like some people” answered Kent “He has not said where he came from yet for ever[el] time he starts to speak the men laugh at him”.\n\n\n        “Well he must have meant something for he shed tears very profusely” commented Ella “And then to call me dear Ella! an impudent rascal! but where did he get my name? I’ll bet it is Albert King disguised. Mr. Kent you had better see if he has false beard or not for you have been looking for Al a long time”\n\n\n[PAGE 319: SC0313_Ms_303]\n\n\nAt hearing Ella’s words a look of blank terror came to the face of the young man beside her and she was alarmed at his deathly paleness — he was trembling like an old man with the palsy, or; chills.\n\n\n        “Why Willie dear you are so pale” said Ella “You had better lean your head on my shoulder or would you rather lay down?” \n\n\n        “I’d rather sit hear[em] dear. I do not feel very bad. I hope I shall feel better after awhile” asserted the young man.\n\n\n        “Yes you will feel better after awhile” thought Kent “you will feel better because you will know your doom. you are in suspense now but you will hear you doom before the sun shall reach the zenith in the heavens this third day of September. you are sick now but you will be as well as I when you hear your doom, aint I glad I have got them stopped for I will now be sure to carry out my plans and finish up this business”\n\n\n[PAGE 320: SC0313_MS_304]\n\n\n        While Kent was speaking his thoughts to himself the young man beside Ella was thinking his “thanks”[en] also.\n\n\n        “If I can only marry her so as to beat him I shall be satisfied” thought the young man “but if he should return the jig is up at once for I will have to ge get out from here as quick as I can. This place aint large enough to both of us so I will simply ‘cut’.”\n\n\n        Strange words for he who had been acknowledged by all the people of Brookland as the amiable William Reed — strange words for him to say to himself and what made them more strange — he had a ‘him’ and ‘her’ as the subject of his conversation with himself.\n\n\n        “I have erred greatly and I must not be caught in my own net” continued he. “I must get out as soon as possible. I will abide my time and if the worse comes I will get up and get. I will go to Chicago again and stay there when I get there I have been foiled in my plans for I got such a terrible beating in Ash hollow but I always tried to make the best of my\n\n\n[PAGE 321: SC0313_MS_305]\n\n\nsituation. now comes my final overthrow.”\n\n\n        The reader must not think the young man was talking aloud, for he was only speaking his thoughts to himself as he sat beside the graceful being who had promised to be his wife. Was she going to keep her promise? We will see in the course of time. We will listen at him awhile longer.\n\n\n        “I just want to marry her to defeat him I dont love her a bit for I have seen a nic nice young lady somewhere in this vicinity that would suit me to a, T., She is a ravishingly beautiful young lady! and I must see her, get acquainted with her and to cap the climax I must marry her! Yes I will by Jove! I will stop my career — my wild career and after begging forgiveness of my friends? no not friend now but those who were once my friends — after obtaining forgiveness I will settle down for life with my pretty little wife. That’s a ryhme[eo] to be sure! but I am\n\n\n[PAGE 322: SC0313_Ms_306]\n\n\nnot turning poet. but turning from my evil ways — not quite turned — to return to my subject: If my friends — those people that minister to my comforts every day — knew what a wicked life I have lead since they saw me leave Brookland they would spurn me from them as they would a dog I expect. ah if the[ep] knew I ____.”\n\n\n        There is no telling what would have been revealed in his reverie had he not been suddenly interrupted by Ella saying:\n\n\n“Willie the young stranger is dismounting. I expect he will come to the house to see if he can sell us a patent right for his patent heart. if he want’s to sell his right he must buy it for this and some of the adjoining counties. that is the way to get a fortune quick” she paused for breath and then continued: “Willie I beleive you are going to have the chills or palsy one. you are trembling like a leaf when shaking Shaken by the wind. do you feel worse than you did a while ago.?” The young man was a pretty long while makin[eq] a reply:\n\n\n[PAGE 323: SC0313_Ms_307]\n\n\nfinally he said as he try to steady his nerves: “I feel pretty bad but I don’t want to lie down until that stranger leaves for he fills me with curiosity to find out who he is, he may be Albert King.”\n\n\n        The two last words fell as if unwillingly from his lips. He tried to look calm but his efforts seemed to be all in vain.\n\n\n        “Yes they are coming to the house” said Ella “and the stranger’s face aint got such a woe begone expression as it had when we were out there why he is laughing!” Ella finished her sentence with an exclamation of surprise for the stranger was indeed laughing as if he was with his friends perhaps he was. We shall see.\n\n\n        “I want to make the revelation to you and reveal myself when I get on the porch where all can hear” the stranger said as he walked along in apparent good humor. Was he to be as a Nemesis on the track of those who had done wrong? Time\n\n\n[PAGE 324: SC0313_Ms_308]\n\n\nwill tell. We must attend to present duties and let the future reveal what is secret now.\n\n\n        The young stranger walked up to the porch in company with Sowers, Herbert, and Hugh. he was still pleading his cause.\n\n\n        He with the rest walked Slowly up the steps of the porch his hopes ran high, his heart beat fast as he at last reached the landing. Kent’s hopes ran high too. “his heart was in his mouth” to use a common expression. The stranger advanced to the middle of the porch and taking his hat in his hand he made a profound bow — Then clearing his throat as if he was going to be orator for th the occasion.\n\n\n        presently he said in a clear voice: “Friends and enemies you have ridiculed me because I said you were my friends and I yours. I was greatly surprised when When I found out you did not know me but I resolved to brave the tempest and convince you all that I am what I say I am. — I am and have always been called, William, Reed.\n\n\nChapter XXVIII\n[PAGE 325: SC0313_Ms_309]\n\n\n        As the two last words recorded in the preceding chapter fell from the supposed stranger’s lips all present except Kent started to their feet confounded– they stood and looked at him as if spell-bound by some supernatural power. Yes they stood gazing intently in the young stranger’s face. He returned the gaze with interest while a bright smile of satisfaction rested on his face. \n\n\n        “You William G. Reed? impossible!” said Sowers as soon as he could find voice to speak. \n\n\n        “I would not swear, that is my right name” said the stranger. “But I’ll declare that is the name I have always been known by”\n\n\n        “you are our Willie then?” said Mattie. \n\n\n        “I am Miss Mattie. I am the so called son of Wilse. Reed.” said the young man “Ella dear I hope you will acknowledge me now as the one you promised to love forever?” continued he turning to Ella. \n\n\n        “Oh Willie will you– can you forgive me?” was all Ella could say as she stood at a \n\n\n[PAGE 326: SC0313_Ms_310]\n\n\ngood distance from him. \n\n\n        “Forgive you for what? I have nothing to forgive you for” said William, for it was really he. “All I ask is for you to come to me I am longing to press you to my breast with a cry of joy Ella ran forward and fairly fell into the young man’s arms. \n\n\n        “Forgive me Ella for not writing to you” murmured the young man as [he] kissed her and pressed her to his heart passionately they were united now— they were determined nothing would part them evermore. They sat down on the bench to talk about their trials and their longing to see one another. WIlliam turned and looked at th Ash hollow gentleman. \n\n\n        “Albert King you have tried to do me a great deal of injury, but I forgive you” said William to the Ash hollow gentleman. The Ash hollow gentleman was Albert. King. and as he heard Willie’s words he rose and ran down through the yard and out across the meadow as if from deadly pursuit. \n\n\n        “Well he is gone now and Mr. kent has been looking for him for so long” said Ella. \n\n\n[PAGE 327: SC0313_Ms_311]\n\n\n        “Mr. Kent been looking for him?” asked Willie, his face showing an expression of great surprise. “Mr. Kent” continued he “How came you to be looking for him when he was here all the time?”\n\n\n        “I didn’t know it was him” replied Kent “But none of you have welcomed this young man to your home” added Kent turning to the host. \n\n\nAll the family then welcomed William to his as well as their home. \n\n\n“We are all glad— very glad to see you” said Mattie, and then came Herbert. \n\n\n“ William please forgive my hasty words” said Herbert holding out his hand, which Willie grasped warmly: \n\n\n        “I forgive you” said Willie “If you have done anything to wrong me. I forgive you But I dont know of anything you have done. as for your hasty words I didn’t hardly hear them, so dont talk about forging forgiveness friend Herbert”\n\n\n[PAGE 328: SC0313_Ms_312]\n\n\n        Hugh Walters then came forward and said he as he extended his hand;\n\n\n        “I am very glad to see you friend Willie. I hope you will not discard my friendship for making such fun of you this morning”\n\n\n        “Dont mention it Hugh” said Willie as he shook his friend’s hand warmly. Wilse Reed was there but he did not seem to be very glad of his son’s (?) return. \n\n\n        “How are you governor? And how have you been?” inquired Willie, turning ^(to) and and addressing his father (?) Wilse walked forward and extended his hand to his sone. \n\n\n        “I am well and have been well” said he “And I beleive[er] you are and have been well.”\n\n\n        “Yes sir I have been well ever since I went away I and I am thankful to say I– have made good use of my time.”\n\n\n        “Willie we want you to tell us your story” said Mattie. “we are all very anxious to hear”\n\n\n        “I want to hear from Al. King first” said Willie. “I am sorry– very sorry that Albert turned out to be such a bad man”\n\n\n[PAGE 329: SC0313_Ms_313]\n\n\n        “Yes we are all sorry for him since we found him out poor fellow” said Mattie sympathizingly. “Oh Willie you have never dreamed how bad Albert King has turned out to be”\n\n\n        “Well tell me all about it.” Said William. \n\n\n        “To begin at the beginning: Albert King had not been seen since you went away” said Ella thinking it proper for her to tell the story. \n\n\n        “Of course we have been nursing him for two months but we didn’t know it”\n\n\n        “I knew it all the time,” said Kent “I hope you will excuse me for interrupting you’ but I must correct all errors that I can. I thought it was he was Albert but you all said he was Willie”\n\n\n        “Yes by the name on the shirt.” said. Ella. “But to go on with my story: you went away on monday. Well monday night Mattie was stabbed by some person, we think it must have been Al King” Ella looked around to see if Wilse Reed was near, he was not and she continued: “Accordingly Mr. Sowers sent for\n\n\n[PAGE 330: SC0313_Ms_314]\n\n\na detective. Mr. Kent, there, came and has been here ever since. but by our erring he has not been able to get Albert yet. Some one also shot through the window on Tuesday night. Who it was and where they came from I am not able to say. \n\n\n        “So time wore on. and on the first of July Albert. King was found in Ash Hollow We all said he was Al. until I saw the name on the shirt– It was your name well we all said he was Willia after that. and so we continued to beleive until you came and forced us to beleive different I can show you the shirt now if you wish to see it— and the suit of clothes too he had them on this morning but he got them off about half-an-hour ago. I  am willing to— well I declare the clothes to be those you had made just before your departure Shall I get them?”\n\n\n        “yes dear, get them for my curiosity is up to the highest pitch” assented Willie. Ella ran up-stairs to get them and while she was gone Mr. Sowers said: \n\n\n\n\n[PAGE 331: SC0313_Ms_315]\n\n\n        “We have started for the Springs twice William but we have got stopped both times, I dont think I shall start again for I will settle up business and leave. I have sold my farm and mill William. I sold it yesterday I am going back to New England soon.”\n\n\n        “Have you sold out? and are you going to New England? well I am glad to hear it.” said Willie. “I am willing to go with you.” \n\n\n        Ella, had returned with the clothes by this time. and She sat down by William[‘s] side and showed him the name on the shirt. \n\n\n        “No I know that shirt by it’s [es]look for Mrs. Sowers made it for you” said Ella. \n\n\n        “Yes that is the shirt and those are the other clothes that were stolen out of my trunk the sunday before I went away” asserted William confidentially. \n\n\n        “Was stolen! When did you say they were stolen?” inquired Ella. “you didn’t say anything about it Willie: or did you not find it out until you came home that \n\n\n[PAGE 332: SC0313_Ms_316]\n\n\nevening?” added Ella inquiringly: \n\n\n        “I didn’t find out until I got back that evening and i thought I wouldn’t say anything to anyone about it” answered Willie “Little did I think Al King had became so low to steal my clothes but I freely forgive him for all he done”\n\n\n        “Well I must go over to the mill.” said Hugh as he rose to go. “William you must come over as soon as you can leave your ladylove” added he jokingly “I am cleaning everything up over there as we are all going to our old home– Boston. Massachusetts.”\n\n\n        “You going too? Why if I had not got back as soon as I did I would have found my self  in a strange land to use an expressive phrase” said. William. \n\n\n        After Hugh had gone to the mill Sowers said: “William your father dont seem to be glad you have come how is that?”\n\n\n        “My father? I just tell you Mr. Sowers I don’t half beleive [et]he is my father” said Willie. “I beleive[eu] I am some  one else’s son. that is my belief[ev]”\n\n\n[PAGE 333: SC0313_Ms_317]\n\n\n        At hearing this, Sowers paled a little. but he soon ‘manned’ himself to use an expressive phrase. He laughed heartily: \n\n\n        “Why you are just like him only you are younger of course you might say that but the very idea is preposterous.”\n        “Preposterous as it may seem to you, I beleive it to be true. I beleive I am not William Reed’s son” said the young man. \n\n\n        “All right my man everbody to their own belief” assented Sowers “But if you take my advice you will banish all such thought from your mind entirely.” commented Sowers. “I suppose you have been picturing to yourself how nice it would be if you were to turn out and prove to be a millionaire’s son. you have been building air-castles have you not?”\n\n\n        “No sir I have not.” replied Willie stiffly: “If my true parents were as poor as the peasants of Europe I would gladly acknowledge them for I want a mother and father’s love”\n\n\n[PAGE 334: SC0313_Ms_318]\n\n\n        “You would make a capital actor” commented Sowers. “a capital actor indeed!”\n\n\n        There was no one on the porch at this particular time so Willie ventured to say: \n\n\n        “Well Mr. Sowers you are acting very suspicious. if there was any mystery about my parentage you are acting as if you wanted to hide it. that is plain talk Mr. Sowers”\n\n\n        “Yes very plain indeed” was all Sowers could manage to say as he rose to leave the porch. Ella soon came back. \n\n\n        “Ella dear I do wish we could get married at once” said William as she took a seat beside him. “But I am still hoping I will yet find a name by which I shall be able to marry you in honor.”\n\n\n        “A name is of very little consequence dear dear Willie our love will be able to stand all consequences whatever” said Ella as she kissed her betrothed. \n\n\n        “Willie I would have made you jealous if you had seen me hugging and kissing Albert King. I forgot to tell you he propose and I rejected him on the\n\n\n[PAGE 335: SC0313_Ms_319]\n\n\nEvening of the twenty-eighth of March”\n\n\n        “Did he propose to you my dearest?” inquired William in astonishment. “I could have told him he would be rejected well he has been doing well since I left no wonder he got hurt for I expect he was at the time engaged in a plot against me. he treated me real mean.”\n\n\n        “Yes he did so . he is a rascal Willie and I am afraid he will do you harm yet.”\n\n\n        “I hope he will not prove to be a healthy undertaking if I catch him at it”\n\n\n        “well you must always be on your guard. dearest, for he might try to do you harm”\n\n\n        “I shall do so but I’ll bet anything Albert King will repent his evil works and that pretty soon, he had a five months’ run of it and he must be getting tired. how does his mother take it? Pretty bad? I guess she thinks he had gone west to seek his fortune.”\n\n\n[PAGE 336: SC0313_Ms_320]\n\n\n        “Yes she has a right hard time of it.” said Ella. They talked on different topics until dinner was ready then they went in to dinner. William was very popular with the colored people so of course he had a talk with them. \n\n\n        Herbert Armstead was there to dinner he seemed never to tire ^(of) staying  there since that happy episode in his life When Mattie had promised to love him. \n\n\n        Dinner being over, all of the family went out on the porch to hear William’s story. “Now Willie tell us your story wont you? We have told you of all the current events.” said Ella. \n\n\n        “All right Ella I will begin with my poor story at once” said William \n\n\n        “Listen attentively all present.”\n\n\nChapter XXIX\n[PAGE 337: SC0313_Ms_321]\n\n\nAll present listened in profound silence.\n\n\n“I started for Chicago — you know when and reached ther[ew] on Thursday evening found a boarding-house and also I rented a room and began life in Chicago as if I intende intended staying there for a young lifetime. I did not stay there any longer than the ninth of April, for there was a number of young men going to the gold miners in California. and I joined them went with them to the gold miners and made my fortune.\n\n\n“We had a great deal of trouble with the Indians — but we surmounted them all. I found a gold mine in which there was a great deal of gold — I was with Fred Morton then — Fred and I were staying together the other boys had “fell out” with us so we were wandering over the plains of the far, far West with no guide — Fred and I were good friends from the first. Well this mine we found proved to be our deliverer. We had\n\n\n[PAGE 338: SC0313_Ms_322]\n\n\nbeen out there a good long while and were getting pretty tired of the gold mining business when we found this vein of gold.\n\n\n“We sat to work in good earnest as soon as we found it we had been working at it about two weeks when an old gentleman — a gold hunter came upon us. He looked into our mine and then offered to buy it we were willing to sell out — especially our Red Brothers ground — so we sat down to bargain.\n\n\n“After about an hour’s talk we effected a bargain with the old man — he agreed to give us one-hundred-thousand dollars each — we kept on until we got him to give each of us double the sum he first offered well he gave us two-hundred thousand each, and we take all the gold we had dug — which by the way was a right good ‘lot.’ we the[ex] ‘set sail’ for Chicago where I parted with my friend and started for my old Virginia home. Fred is as rich as he ought to be he is married now — he married before I left Chicago for I stayed there two weeks before I started home. I chose my present garb to insure my life generally speaking.”\n\n\n[PAGE 339: SC0313_Ms_323]\n\n\n“What became of your other men?” inquired Ella. “Did they get rich too?“\n\n\n“I could not tell you what became of them for I have not saw or heard anything of them since we parted” answered Willie.\n\n\n“So you are a rich man. your friend Fred ought to come to see you sometime.” said Ella. “I suppose you will go to see him after you get your business all fixed.”\n\n\n“Yes I intend to see him before another six months shall pass away” replied Willie.\n\n\nDoctor Maltby was seen coming down the lane in his buggy he soon drove up beside the porch and with an air of surprise he said half enquiringly: “You all not gone yet why what is the matter? Hello! Where is my patient? has he got worse and gone to bed?”\n        \n        “Well doctor to speak expressively your patient has gone to happier hunting grounds he stacked his arm and fled” asserted William in a half jocose voice.\n\n\n[PAGE 340: SC0313_MS_324]\n\n\n        “Has he ran away?” asked the doctor.\n\n\n        “I don’t know your name sir” added he addressing William “May I have the honor of knowing with whom I am talking?”\n\n\n        “You may sir if you call it honor — you are addressing William G. Reed or at least I have always been known by that name” asserted William proudly:\n\n\n        “You william. G. Reed impossible! Why Willie has been here for two months sir you are an imposter if I judge aright”\n\n\n        “You were greatly mistaken doctor for you have been attending Albert King for two months I am certainly known by the name you mentioned. but I would not swear that I am William Reed — I may be some one else for all I know” said William assuringly:\n\n\n        “All of those people you see here were doing their best to drive me away awhile ago but I stood my ground like a man. come doctor aint you going to shake a friend’s hand?” William ended his paragraph in an inquiry as he extended the member above mentioned — to the doctor.\n\n\n[PAGE 341: SC0313_Ms_325]\n\n\n        “Certainly Willie I will do so with the greatest pleasure” said the doctor as he shook the young man’s hand. “I am glad — very glad to see you my dear boy.”\n\n\n        A shadow of doubt gathered in the doctor’s mind as he thought of the clothes which the Ash Hollow gentleman was found in.\n\n\n        “Look here young man I want an explanation about those clothes.” said the doctor eyeing William suspiciously “your name, or at least the name of ‘William G. Reed’ was on the clothes. he also had on the low quartered shoes I bought for you or at least I advised you to buy them” the doctor kept a close eye upon William all the time he was Speaking. a Smile of satisfaction played upon William’s features as he said: \n\n\n        “I can easily do that. I can easily explain all your suspicion away” He then related all about the stolen clothes in as few words as possible at the conclusion he said “now I have freed you from all\n\n\n[PAGE 342: SC0313_MS_326]\n\n\ndoubts and I am free from suspicion.”\n\n\n        “Yes and I thank you for your information for it was very valuable to me as I wish to tell Mrs. King a true story when I get home.” asserted Doctor Maltby “I’ll bid you all Au revoir for I must go.” added the doctor as he suited action to his word.\n\n\n        Arriving at his office he had his horse attended to and then went in to break the news he had gathered to Mrs. King.\n\n\n        “Mrs. King I have come with Some news for you at last” said he as he took a seat.\n\n\n        “good or bad news doctor?” inquired Mrs. King \n\n\n        “Well good news in one way and at the same time bad the other way” said the doctor “You must take all quietly for I think you will See your son before long.”\n\n\n        “Does the news concern my son?” hastily inquired the lady. “If so tell me quick!”\n\n\n        “Be easy now as the Irishmen always say be ‘asy as ye can an I will be as brief as I can; The young man we have been nursing so long at Brookland is your Albert and he has ran away again for William — the real\n\n\n[PAGE 343: SC0313_Ms_327]\n\n\nWilliam came home this morning” said the doctor.\n\n\n        “He has ran away again? Oh my God!” groaned Mrs. King “I have always had a great deal of trouble since I left home!”\n\n\n        “Hope for the best Mrs. King.” said the doctor consolingly: “I think he has com had I got his fill of running around and he will be home in a few days They have forgiven him all” The doctor meant to tell her all about the detective but he remembered his promise and refrained f doing so.\n\n\n        “If he comes soon I will leave Virginia and never set foot on its soil anymore for I have never had nothing but trouble since here I have been.” said Mrs. King. “How came you to make a mistake in his identity doctor” inquired she after a few moments silence\n\n\n        “Well his face was so badly scarred as to render ind identification entirely out of the question so we all went — or more properly we used we were all guided by the name on the clothes” replied the doctor.\n\n\n[PAGE 344: SC0313_Ms_328]\n\n\n        The conversation ended upon that subject for it was a subject that was disagreeable. — both to the doctor and Mrs. King Time slipped away. a week passed and this is the way Kent had planned for his party and grand finale– .\n\n\nHe had persuaded them to have a large party in in honor of William’s arrival. So after gaining their consent both by their agreeing to the party and also for him to invite as many f to the party as he wished. He issued invitations all around. To Mrs. King and family Mr Armstead and family &c. &c. He also sent a special invitation to a gentleman, his wife and daughter who were boarding at the Taylor Hotel. He sent special invitations to those three. his motive will be fully understood before this narrative comes to a close. The party was to be on Friday night the 21st of September; this was the 1 10th so he had plenty of time to mature his plans for the grand finale.\n\n\nAnother week passed befor[ey] he had matured his plans for he intended acting a part in\n\n\n[PAGE 345: SC0313_Ms_329]\n\n\nthe finale so he wanted to be experienced in his part so as not to make a blunder.\n\n\n        Hasty preparations were also being made to move. There was five families all going to Boston Massachusetts. all the people of Brookland were expecting to go. Will they all go away from Brookland alive? we shall see.\n\n\n        William had spoken many a word of love to Ella during their quiet interval, he was now reaping the benefits of his untiring energy in the pursuit of wealth and happiness.\n\n\n        Herbert, also had also Spoken many a word of love he had not set the time for their marriage but he had almost matured all his other plans. This morning of the sixteenth of September he and his betrothed were sitting side by side on the porch chatting away as fast as they could — “Bertie our party will soon come off” said Mattie, the two last words are common among the Virginians as they are handy and expressive words.\n\n\n        “Let see” said Herbert “This is Sunday, why it\n\n\n[Page 346 placed in wrong location in manuscript; Originally P.165 MS_157]\n[PAGE 165: SC0313_Ms_157] [Page torn; number missing][ez][fa]\n\n\nwill come off next Friday night that is the time Kent is to—”\n\n\nHerbert left his sentence unfinished. \n\n\n“What were you going to say Wil Bertie?” inquired Mattie for she noticed his sudden stop and the nervous twitching of his face. \n\n\n“I say that is to be the last pleasure for Kent in Virginia— for Kent or any of us for we will all go about the last of this month” The young man fixed up a good answer for his betrothed for it quietened all curiosity on her part. William and his adored came out on the porch for a chat. a quiet chat. \n\n\n        “Let’s all take a walk up the lane.” suggested Ella. her suggestion proved to be a good one for they all took a walke up the lane. The weather was still good but the air was quite cool. The people of Brookland were expecting an equinoctial gale about the twentieth of the month. So all the flour and wheat was gotten out of the mill. The girls, or young ladies and their lovers went to church on that Sunday and spent a pleasant day. \n\n\n[PAGE 347: SC0313_Ms_331] [page number torn; no chapter title present][fb]\n\n\nKent spent the day very pleasantly too. he went to see Mrs. Barton and stayed a long while at her house. in truth he felt sorry for her. he knew more of her former life than she ever dreamed he knew. \n\n\n        Monday morning came and the fol people of Brookland were astir early. \n\n\n        The equinoctial clouds were faintly visible in the Western horizon they were very small –yet they were indicative of a heavy storm– the small creeks in Virginia swell as large as rivers in the time of those equinoctial storms, This was what the people of Brookland were expecting. some of them said the old mill was sure to wash be washed away in this particular storm as it was only a frame building and It was very old. \n\n\n        Sowers had made a many a dollar in that old mill, now it had passed into other hands and was to be torn down and a new and more substantial one built in it’s[fc] site. \n\n\n[PAGE 346: SC0313_Ms_330] [This is Page 348]\na about three o’clock Monday evening Dr Maltby came by Sowers’ or at least he stopped there a Short while and then went on to Winchester he had his horse attended to and then went in the parlor to have a chat with Mrs. King. \n\n\n        “How are you this evening” [crossed out word] said he as he entered the parlor.\n\n\n        “I am quite well doctor how are you?” said Mrs King the doctor was well — always well so they soon fell got into an interesting conversation which lasted near an hour. the doctor was about to leave the room when the door was suddenly darkened. Mrs. King and himself noticed the door was darkened, but before they could turn their heads, a voice from the door way said plaintively:\n\n\n                “Mother! forgive me”\n\n\nChapter XXX\n[Page 349 Missing – Chapter XXX title page]\n\n\n\n\n[PAGE 350: SC0313_Ms_332]\n\n\n        “Take a seat my son and tell me all about it” resumed the lady. “First, speak to the doctor and thank him for attending you so patiently and nursing you back to life’ added the lady. Albert walked with unsteady step to the doctor and extended his hand, which the doctor grasped warmly. \n\n\n        “Doctor I am grateful for what you have done for me, if you had known whom you were attending, and how unworthy I was of attention you would not have—”\n\n\n        “Yes I would have attended you all the same” said the doctor quickly detecting the import of the young man’s words. \n\n\n        Abert[fd] sat down on the sofa to tell of his wanderings when he suddenly recollected what he had heard when at Brookland about Mattie Sowers being stabbed the day after he was missing. a startled look of fear came into his face. \n\n\n        “Mother I am suspected of stabbing Mattie Sowers, every-body at Brookland suspect me. What shall I do? if I am indicted on such a charge?” inquired the youn man. \n\n\n[PAGE 351: SC0313_Ms_333]\n\n\n“you suspected of stabbing Mattie Sowers!” repeated Mrs. King in a hollow voice “Why I dont know what you are to do. but tell my son, tell me truly did you do such a thing were you so depraved as to try to kill Mattie Sowers, either by stabbing her or shooting her? tell me truly.” \n\n\nThe young man placed his hand on the family bible as it was laying on the centre table in front of him— he placed his hand on it and said in an impressive voice: \n\n\n        “In the presence of you both and also in the presence of Almighty God I solemnly declare I had nothing at all to do with the stabbing of Mattie Sowers— or the shooting at her either— I knew nothing at all about it until I got nearly well, Ella Armstead told me about it, i declare this before God.” The young man’s words were very impressive. “Do you beleive [fe]me mother and doctor?” inquired the young man. \n\n\n        “yes we beleive[ff] you” said Dr. Maltby and\n\n\n[PAGE 352: SC0313_Ms_334]\n\n\nMrs. King in one voice. \n\n\n        “Mother I am going to be a better man”asserted the young man “I am going to brave this out since I see you and Doctor Maltby beleive [fg]me innocent, I will lead a better life. William said he forgave me all I did against him— but he dont know what I tried to do, mother I tried to kill him!”\n\n\n        “You tried to kill William Reed! Oh Albert whatever caused you to do so?”\n\n\n        “Money!” the words fell listlessly from the young man’s lips as he wiped a tear from his eyes. \n\n\n        “Tell me all about your wandering my son.” said Mrs. King “I want to hear where you have been and what has been your occupation since you left home so unceremoniously”\n\n\n        “I will tell you all mother” was the young man’s reply: “I went up to Greenwood Church with WIlliam the last Sunday he was here– for he went away on the next day— I came home here and got some of my clothes telling you I thought it would be more handy to have them at the Mill I went from here to the mill and breaking William’s trunk open\n\n\n[PAGE 353: SC0313_Ms_335]\n\n\n–no I unlocked his trunk with a false key and took out a suit of his best clothes— also two shirts and a pair of low quartered shoes I carried them off to a den I had found in Ash hollow. I came here that night and took my trunk away. I had help but I will not betray any but myself at present. \n\n\n        “I stole a horse and wagon and hauled my trunk out to my den in Ash hollow— well I stayed in my den until Monday night I then went to Brookland and got money to travel with for I had been hired to kill William. Reed. I stole another horse and wagon to take me to Harpers–ferry– I drove the whole distance by daylight next morning and got on the cars with a through ticket for Chicago I arrived in Chicago on Friday evening proceeded to one of the first-class boarding houses and called for the registering book. I found the name of William\n\n\n[PAGE 354: SC0313_Ms_336]\n\n\nG. Reed on the register and after finding that I had my name registered as ‘Marcus Jones’ I was satisfied that I would soon accomplish my work so after assuming an appropriate disguise I undertook to watch him. I succeeded very well for a day or two– then I missed him and could not get on his track again. I however found out after a long while that he had William had gone to  California so I concluded I would give up the idea of ever killing him But didn’t let my employers know it\n\n\n        “I sent to my employer for more money and received it– then I went into high living. I changed my place of board and took a more stylish boarding house.\n\n\n        “My funds at last were nearly run out and I wrote for more but never got any or heard from Brookland at all. \n\n\n        “I started for home about the last of June and I was on my way to my den in Ash hollow early on the morning of the second of July– it was very early and some highwaymen knocked me on the head and \n\n\n[PAGE 355: SC0313_Ms_337]\n\n\nfinding I had no money the[fh] pounded me nearly to death. fortunately Kent the detective was out roving early that morning and he found me so he says and took me home— that is to Brookland– there by the medical skill of Doctor Maltby I was nursed back to life for I could not have lived if some one not skilled in the medical profession had not attended me. \n\n\n“My idea in coming home  was to tell the people of Brookland that William was doing right well but he wanted to borrow about a thousand dollars and had sent me after it. I was also intending to tell you that William and I were in the same business. Oh how I did plot and play. I had on the suit of clothes that I stole from William, not thinking anyone would ever see the name I left it on there, and behold it betrayed me and I am glad of it.”\n\n\nWhen the young man ceased speaking, an impressive silence reigned Supreme for a \n\n\n[PAGE 356: SC0313_Ms_338]\n\n\nconsiderable time. finally it was broken by Doctor Maltby saying: \n\n\n        “Albert, you must keep in until Friday night the party goes on then, and we will go out and there you can make a confession before them all.” Then turning to Mrs. King the doctor said: “you mustn’t let any one know your son has come back for the detective will have him lodged in jail before Friday if he gets the least wind of his return home.” Mrs. King looked bewildered; \n“I hear you saying so much about a detective, where is the detective? I never heard of him being here until you said so today” said Mrs. King. \n\n\n“Well he has been here ever since last April when Sowers sent for him” answered the doctor. \n\n\n“For reasons best known to himself Kent had his presence made a secret, he was thought to be a visitor of Mr. Sowers. as soon as he came he had a dispatch sent to police head-quarters in Sowers name, stating that Sowers didn’t want a detective, but so doing he was not suspiciouned[fi] of being a detective. I knew all the time that he was a detective but as I was in the secret I said nothing at all about it to anyone.”\n\n\n[PAGE 357: SC0313_Ms_339]\n\n\n        “Were they hunting for my boy?” inquired Mrs. King “Hunting him down, thinking he was the intended assassin of Mattie Sowers?”\n\n\n“yes” answered the doctor. “They were, for his absence at this particular time and the way in which he absented himself combined, tended to prove that he was the culprit.”\n\n\n“Well who is the real culprit? can anyone tell?” inquired Mrs. King for she was anxious to hear. \n\n\n“Time will tell. we will know who is the real culprit ere a month passes on by.” answered the doctor in his usual calm voice. \n\n\n“Where have you been for the last two weeks my son?” queried Mrs. King; turning to, Albert. \n\n\n        “I have been wandering around, all through this country begging my bread” answered Albert truthfully. “I have been sometimes assuming the garb of the regular mendicant for the last two weeks. Then I put on at other times a false beard and as I had some toys I went about peddling, taking care to go to some large farm-house always about meal-time.”\n\n\n[PAGE 358: SC0313_Ms_340]\n\n\n        “Why you have had a great variety of life.” said the doctor “You have at least, learned how to make a living for yourself  in various ways Should need be.” added the doctor. \n\n\n        “Yes sir It seemed as if fortune favored me.” asserted Albert “Although I was engaged in fiendish work, I had good luck all the way through, but I have changed my ways now and I hope to be a better man in the future.”\n\n\n        “I am glad to hear you say that Albert” said Mrs. King “I am glad you have consented to stop your wandering around as if you were crazy. and as Mr. Sowers. Mrs. Walters and Mr. Armstead are going back to New England, I will go too for I am tired of living here, I have had nothing but trouble since I have been here, you are willing to go are you Albert?”\n\n\n“Yes mother I am willing to go. I want to do all I can for you now to make up for lost time.” replied, Albert. \n\n\n“I think I shall go away from here too this autumn” said doctor Maltby. “I have got tired of Virginia too.” as well as \n\n\n[PAGE 359: SC0313_Ms_341]\n\n\nthe rest of you. This is a dull town anyhow.”\n\n\n“Yes very dull. I believe the rest of the “New. Englanders” are going to Boston, and I guess I will go there too.” Said Mrs. King. \n\n\n“Albert they are going to open a large Commission house in Boston and I expect you can get employment with them.”\n\n\n“I hope I may be that fortunate” asserted Albert. “I will be more faithful than I have heretofore been. for I wasn’t much account when I was in the mill.”\n\n\n        It was near supper time so Albert went up to his room and prepared for supper. \n\n\n        Mrs. King told Ann, and Dick not to say anything about Albert coming home, they promised they would not, so She was satisfied that her plan for keeping Albert hid would succeed, all she she had to do was to keep him in the house as the doctor suggested. Well supper time came and the three assembled in the dining room to partake of the frugal meal. \n\n\n[PAGE 360: SC0313_Ms_342]\n\n\n        “This is the first time I have eaten a peaceful meal since I left home.” asserted Albert in the course of the conversation. “I hope it is not the last.” \n\n\n        “No, I trust you shall eat a great many more such meals” said Mrs. King. \n\n\n        “Well I must go out again,” said the doctor. \n\n\n“There is no rest for the wicked.” added he as he arose from the table and started to his office, which by the way was not very far away, he went into his office and prepared himself for going out in the meantime Dick got his horse ready. \n\n\nAlbert layed down on the sofa to rest for he was very tired. \n\n\n        “Mother I feel so much better since I have obtained forgiveness from you.” said Albert. \n\n\n        “I hope you will always lead a life here after that will not need forgiveness, but of the great one that rules the universe he will for-give you” said Mrs. King. \n\n\n        So the balance of the week passed away quietly with the people of Mrs. King’s household. and we turn our attention elsewhere. \n\n\nChapter XXXI\n[PAGE 361: SC0313_Ms_343]\n\n\nFriday morning came dull, cloudy and cheerless. About nine o’clock the rain began pouring down — — a Slow Steady rain. we omitted to say in the preceding chapter that the equinoctial rain commenced on Monday night. It commenced in the middle of the night above named and had rained all the rest of the week.\n        \n        The day was not one on which any one likes to prepare for a party, but our Brookland people were putting the finishing touch to their preparations for the party. Kent was in good Spirits, if he could only get the three persons at the Taylor Hotel to come out to the party he felt that he would be all right. The water had overflowed the banks of the creek. everything of value had been taken out of the mill for It was expected to be washed away.\n\n\n        We must go into details on this particular d day but we will be brief if possible. Herbert Armstead; had gone home but he \n\n\n[PAGE 362: SC0313_Ms_344]\n\n\nwas to be at Brookland on that day for certain. Hugh Walters went to his home on Thursday evening intending to return on the following evening to the party. William G. Reed, our hero was still at Brookland. he had Spent a very pleasant time there since he had come.\n\n\n        Ella had been to her home but was now at Brookland. our Readers must not think that She Stayed at Brookland the best portion of her time. She was there though pretty often. but Still She payed strict attention to her home for She love[fj] her parents dearly and had always obeyed them in all things. if they wanted her home the very day She had intended to go away She would stay. make no difference how important her intention was.\n\n\n        Wilse Reed was Still there. he had not visited Mrs. Barton since they had, had that quarrel. Wilse Seemed in an awful dread all the time for fear Kent was going to do him some injury or tell anything on him. That was if he knew anything.\n\n\n[PAGE 363: SC0313_Ms_345]\n\n\nKate Barton was Still there and as full of gossip as ever. She visited the Sowers mansion very often since William had come She was like one of the person mentioned in the bible, her hand was against everyone and everyone’s hand was against her.\n\n\n        Mrs. Barton was also preparing to leave Virginia. Kent had promised to see her safely established in New England his words had a meaning she never dreamed of She was to be established there different to her fondest expectations.\n\n\n        Sowers had ceased to let Wilse Reed have any control over him. but Wilse didn’t seem to care for revealing the secret he had so long tortured Sowers with. When Kent told Sowers of the three persons at the Taylor Hotel that he had invited Sowers turned very pale for he did not wish to see them, he had not Seen them for a good while nor did he ever wish to see them, however he was\n\n\n[PAGE 364: SC0313_Ms_346]\n\n\ndestined to see them at the party.\n\n\n        Mattie, was growing prettier under the influence of Herbert’s love, they had not set the day for their marriage yet nor did they intend to until the[fk] were established in New England. then they intended to fix the exact date of their marriage.\n\n\n        Mrs. Sowers and her kitchen people were getting along as well as usual. for She always got along well with them. Uncle Jack had “Sworn off” since he had been assured of liberty a name in itself that is delightful to heare, yes he had Sworn he would never drink another drop of Whiskey. Mrs. Sowers had taught him the words of a speaker who is anonymus[fl] to myself the words she had taught him were these: — Out venoms all the worms of the Nile The worm of the Still.\n\n\n        Jack had paid particular attention to her words for he had been bitten by this venomous reptile and had suffered from the effects of the bite for a good long while. He heard and heeded.\n\n\n[PAGE 365: SC0313_Ms_347]\n\n\n        Aunt Sally had ceased to hate “free niggers.” for she was living in hopes of becoming one herself and the day was not far off when She could say she was free.\n\n\n        George was living in anticipation of seeing his parents soon for they had moved to Boston some considerable time before the opening of our Story — and by the laws of the State of Virginia they could not come back to Winchester to live any more — that was the law there at that time — now all persons without regard to race or color can roam awhe anywhere in the United States they choose. to use an expressive phrase: “Everybody can go to see Everybody, So no Nobody had a chance to say that Somebody didn’t go to see Anybody”\n\n\n        That is the way you can do in the, U.S; now — if a man has a good moral character — whether he has capital or not he can soon work his way to a prominent position in Society. — To be honest and upright is to be a man \n\n\n[PAGE 366: SC0313_Ms_348]\n\n\nand as it is said: a rule is a poor one if it wont work both ways, So to be a man is to be upright and honest.\n\n\n        Any person may say Slavery is right — they may sat Say it is right, but they would rather be free — a great many persons say it is to the slave’s advantage to be a Slave. I can’t see it in that light. a Slave has not the advantages of education, and it has been asserted that Education is necessary, as a learned profession. We all know that on this dull morning William was sitting in the parlor reading the news. Ella was sitting by his side. for She considered that as her right. She didn’t know that her life was in danger — She did not know She was to have a pistol levelled at her head when the party began.\n\n\n        She knew not that She had a deadly enemy lurking near with a Smiling face — a wolf in Sheep’s clothing. She sat there beside her lover and at intervals when he was not reading an interesting “peice[fm]” She would talk to him of the party — Kent’s grand\n\n\n[PAGE 367: SC0313_Ms_349]\n\n\nfinale. for Kent intended to go home on Monday after the party. he was eager to See his family. he had been away from them for near six months.\n\n\n        In the afternoon of the day in question the rain ceased. The water had arisen to a fearful hight and was roaring like a “young Niagra falls.” The mill was momentarily expected to be washed away for it was not a very substantial Structure.\n\n\n        Kent walked up the lane that lead along the creek, as he walked along, gazing intently at the water he recollected about the paper he had found. So going near the edge of the water where there was an eddy and the water was not quite so muddy as at other places he stooped and held the paper under the water as before. and with a Smile of satisfaction he said: “I will use that paper tonight if I can get everything to come out as I wish. I will then be done my work.”\n\n\n[PAGE 368: SC0313_Ms_350]\n\n\n        We will tell our Readers what was on the paper when a more convenient Season comes, for the present we cannot. Wilson Reed had been invited to the party the same as any other guest. and he of course accepted the invitation. not thinking what was to be the final termination of his enjoyment. (?)\n\n\n        He knew not that Nemesis was on his track and was to catch up with him on on this particular night.\n\n\n        Kent took the paper out of his pocket the water and deposited it in his pocket on reaching the house he found Hugh Walters and his Sister there, also Some others of the Walters’ family.\n\n\n        “Mr. Walters how does this weather use you?” said Kent as he took a seat in the parlor. “It has been a very rainy day:”\n\n\n        “Well it don’t hurt me any.” said Hugh. “But we are certainly having plenty of rain.”\n\n\n        “Yes, I think the old mill will go down soon for it is a very frail Structure” asserted So Kent taking a look at the\n\n\n[PAGE 369: SC0313_Ms_351]\n\n\nmill for it was right in front of the window, before which he sat.\n\n\n        “A very frail structure and a very old one.” Said William for he too was in the parlor “That old mill has withstood an many a gale the waters have threatened it more than once.” added William after a short pause.\n\n\n        “I dont think I ever saw the water so high in my life” asserted Mattie. “I wonder if Bertie can get across the creek when he comes” queried she, suddenly remembering her lover for he had not got there as soon as they expected him. It was near five o’clock and they had seen nothing of him as yet.\n\n\n        “I’ll bet you Herbert will get across” asserted Hugh. “For he has got a very faithful horse — a horse that would die to save his master.”\n\n\n        “Yes old Roan is a very good horse.” said Ella. “Bertie has made him Swim across the Opequon creek more than once and it is a larger creek than this.”\n\n\n[PAGE 370: SC0313_Ms_352]\n\n\n        “That is him coming down the hill now is it not?” queried Kent.\n\n\n        “Yes it is him sure enough” said the all in one voice. “Let’s go out and see him come across for old Roan swims so pretty”\n\n\n        So saying they went out to See him come across. He saw them and gave a loo loud cheer. his faithful horse began the difficult task of crossing the swift stream. It was a hard task but it was accomplished at last and Herbert rode up to the stable after speaking to his friends. putting his horse in the stable he then went in the house and jonied[fn] his friends. his first words were:\n\n\n        “Well Mattie our party is to be to night for certain if a few more guests will come.”\n\n\n        “Yes we will have a quiet little party.” said Mattie. “Your mother and father are not coming are they Bertie?”\n\n\n        “Well they went up to Winchester yesterday and they have not come back yet. I guess you will see them this evening.” answered Herbert.\n\n\n        “They went up the Senseney[fo] road in our buggy.”\n\n\n[PAGE 371: SC0313_Ms_353]\n\n\n“That is the reason we did not see them.” said Ella. “They didn’t say anything to me about it when I was there.”\n        \n        “I know they didn’t for they just took a motion to go late in the evening” said Bertie: “They wanted to come to the party and were afraid the water would raise so in the creek they couldn’t cross so they went to town and I am certain the[fp] will be here in the course of an hour.”\n\n\n        “Hugh are any more of your people coming?” asked Mattie. “I hope they will”\n\n\n        “Yes mother, father and Some of others of the family are coming out.” answered Hugh.\n\n\n        “I hope my friends at the Taylor hotel will not dissappoint me” asserted Kent: “That old gentleman’s daughter is a pretty young lady Hugh, you had better ‘set your cap’ for her” added Kent laughingly.\n\n\n        “You may be joking but I am in earned earnest, she is a very fascinating young lady. I saw her the other day.” said Hugh.\n\n\n[PAGE 372: SC0313_Ms_354]\n\n\n        “Well I hope they will come” said Willie “For I like to look at pretty l ladies.” he cast a look at Ella, a merry twinkle in his eye. he saw no jealousy in her pure face. nothing but love could he see in her as She returned his look with interest.\n\n\n        “I just feel like a merry party” asserted Herbert. he knew not what this party would prove to be for Kent had not given him any particulars.\n\n\n        Looking out of a side window Herbert saw a carriage coming down the lane\n\n\n“There comes some one. It is Doctor Maltby and Mrs. King” said Herbert as he hastened to the front door. It was the doctor and Mrs. King coming out to the party and as they drew near, a third person became visible. Herbert saw there was a third person in the carriage so he wondered whom it could be.\n\n\n        Ella came out on the porch too and she was soon followed by Kent, Hugh, Willie, and the rest of the guests.\n\n\n        “Who is the third person in the carriage?” asked Ella.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII\n\n\n[PAGE 373: SC0313_Ms_355]\n\n\n        “I can’t tell you until I find out” replied Herbert. “We will soon see who it is for here they are now.” added Herbert as the carriage drew up before the stile [?].\n\n\n        Doctor. Maltby. got out and assisted Mrs. King and then the “third” person got out– he was no other than Albert. King. he had been brave enough to come out to Brookland to declare his innocence. as far as the stabbing of Mattie Sowers was concerned. he walked up on the porch beside the doctor he looked very pale and agitated. but he braved it out\n\n\n        “good evening ladies and gentlemen”said doctor Maltby, and Mrs. King as they stopped on the porch, the usual greetings soon being over they went into the parlor All present, spoke to Albert as they didn’t like to hurt Mrs. King’s feelings. \n\n\nWhen they reached the parlor they found Mr. Sowers and wife there, also Kent, his eyes brightened as he saw the young man\n\n\n[PAGE 374: SC0313_Ms_356]\n\n\nwith the scarred face. \n\n\n        Poor penitent Albert was greeted very coldly, When the ordinary greetings of polite society had been exchanged, Albert stepped out into the middle of the room– his head erect– his steps firm– and said: \n\n\n        “Friends, and Enemies: I came here this evening to declare my innocence in regard to the Stabbing of Miss. Mattie. I knew nothing of it until Miss. Ella. told me. I declare upon God’s holy Book. I am innocent!”\n\n\n        The young man paused and looked eagerly into the face of his hearers. he saw by their looks they did not beleive [fq]him–\n\n\n        “On What grounds do you make this charge— you have not made it to me yet– but I have found out all about while I was playing traitor. The question is what grounds have you for making the charge? I always liked Miss Mattie” The young man spoke his the words fluently, and in a way that no one but those with a clear conscience could speak.\n\n\n        Sowers rose and said in a cool tone: \n[Page 375 missing] \n\n\n[PAGE 376: SC0313_Ms_357]\n\n\n        Kent, after seeing this rose up and started out of the room. Albert had sat down beside his mother and as Kent passed by him he whispered: \n        \n        “Be of good cheer young man I beleive[fr] you innocent and will do all I can for you.”\n\n\n        no one noticed him as they were deeply absorbed in other matters of more importance. Albert rose again, and walking over to where William and Ella. sat he said as he extended his hand to William: \n\n\n        “William, I hope you will forgive me for all I have done.” William grasped the proffered hand and said: \n\n\n        “Yes Albert I freely forgive you for all you have tried to do to me— I say all and I mean all. though I have not heard exactly what you tried to do”\n\n\n        “I will tell you all.” said Albert, he then related in as few words as possible. where he had wandered and for what purpose. in conclusion he asked anxiously: \n\n\n        “And you for give me all, after hearing my fiendish plans— plans for your destruction?”\n\n\n[PAGE 377: SC0313_Ms_358]\n\n\n        “I forgive all, and we will be friends the same as we used to be” said Willie,\n\n\n        “You will not tell who were your employers?” asked William. he did not notice the nervous twitching on Sowers’ face. \n\n\n        “no I’ll tell on none but myself, the rest must be revealed some day.” replied Albert. “And now” turning to Ella. “Now Miss Ella I ask you to forgive me my hasty and thoughtless words” as he spoke he extended his hear hand which she grasped as she said in calm forgiving tones: \n\n\n        “I forgive you Albert for you were at the time suffering with temporary insanity so of course I forgive you and I wish Bertie to do so” concluded she, glancing at her brother, Herbert stood up and taking Albert’s hand in his’ he said: \n\n\n        Albert I had nothing against you but what you said to my sister, if she forgives what you threatened to do to her, of course I have no right to object.”\n\n\n[PAGE 378: SC0313_Ms_359]\n\n\n        “Thank God thank god!” was all Albert could manage to say. as he proceeded to his seat. the doctor then arose and said:\n\n\n        “Mr. and Mrs. Sowers I beleive[fs] Albert is innocent of the charge made against him. What could have been his motive in so doing? You can’t bring any argument at all that would cause any one to beleive[ft] him guilty after hearing him declare his innocence so boldly. let this difficulty be settled at once for he is innocent.”\n\n\n        Mrs. Sowers, arose and advanced toward Albert The young man ran to meet her so great was his joy when he saw what was her intention. “Do you beleive[fu] me innocent?” he asked in his breathless anxiety. \n\n\n“Yes Albert I know you are innocent of the charge brought against you.” replied Mrs. Sowers as she shook the young man’s extended hand. We must premise the fact that Hugh and Annie Walters, also some of his other relatives went into the dining-room to stay awhile for they didn’t wish to witness the scene in the  \n\n\n[PAGE 379: SC0313_Ms_360]\n\n\nthat was being enacted in the parlor. \n\n\n        “Well I must also extend the hand of friendship” said Sowers, sarcastically. \n\n\n        “Not unless you beleive[fv] me innocent” asserted Albert. “If you beleive[fw] me innocent of the charge made against me we will shake hands as a token of friendship.”\n\n\n        “I with the others beleive[fx] you innocent” said Sowers in an earnest mood as he grasped Albert’s hand warmly. \n\n\n        Immediately after this, Mattie went into the dining room and invited the guests in the parlor– the guests that were sitting in the first-named room. \n\n\n        “The amazing farce is over then? Eh Mattie?” inquired Hugh as he with the other rose to go to the parlor. “How did Al. get off? has Kent took him in custody?”\n\n\n        “No indeed, Albert is as innocent of the charge made against him as you or anyone under this roof at present.” affirmed Mattie earnestly. \n\n\n[PAGE 380: SC0313_Ms_361]\n\n\n        “You beleive[fy] him innocent then” said Hugh with a broad laugh. \n\n\n        “I know he is” asserted Mattie. They had reached the parlor then and they said no more on the subject. Hugh walked up to Albert –a mischievous smile upon his face– and said carelessly as he took hold of Albert’s hand: \n\n\n        “Well Al old fellow where have you been so long? how are you and how have you been all this while I am a glad to see you old boy as I I would have been if I had lost my pocket-book” and then in an emphatic voice— “Providing the pocket book had no money in it.”\n\n\n“I’ll tell you at some future time where I have been” said Albert “Let it suffice for me to say now that I am very glad to meet you once more and find you are still my friend” Albert’s last words were spoken half enquiringly. \n\n\n        “Oh yes, always your friend Albert, you have never done me any harm” asserted Hugh. “But here is my sister. I will introduce you to her, that is if you\n\n\n[PAGE 381: SC0313_Ms_362]\n\n\nare not already acquainted?” concluded Hugh. \n\n\n        “We are not” said Albert as his eyelids drooped under the influence of those dark eyes which were peering at him. \n\n\n        “Mr. Albert, P. King, Miss Annie. C Walters” said Hugh in a clear voice. The style at that time was to shake hands when introduced to anyone. So Albert took the proffered hand and said as he did so: \n\n\n        “I am happy to make your acquaintance Miss. Walters. how have you been?”\n\n\n        “Thank you. Mr. King. I have been well” responded the beautiful girl, blushingly. Albert forgot all his troubles, he was like Josh Billings on boots, Josh says: “Tite butes are a luxury as they cause a man to furgit all his other mizeries[fz][ga][gb]” So it was with Albert the sight of this young lady caused him to forget all his other miseries. This was the girl he had been muttering about to himself. he had caught sight of her before he left Winchester but had\n\n\n[PAGE 382: SC0313_Ms_363]\n\n\nnever had a chance to get acquainted  with her as she had not been in Winchester very long. Albert took a seat near her after she had been introduced to the doctor and Mrs. King. he took a seat beside her and began a conversation that was agreeable to both. he was not a bad looking man so Annie thought, so she chatted away freely. Herbert was not idle.. Neither was William. but Hugh was, as far as talking to the ladies was concerned. So he chatted with the doctor and Mr. Sowers. then as Mrs. King was a widow lady he determined not to be beat– turned and began to chat. To be brief they were all busily and very pleasantly employed. \n\n\n        Kent had not returned as yet. \n\n\n        The sun had sunk to rest behind the western hills and they were looking every moment for the ladies and gentlemen from the Taylor hotel. finally looking out they saw saw the long looked for three persons for their carriage had already stopped at the stile. \n\n\n[PAGE 383: SC0313_Ms_364]\n\n\n        Hugh did not know that he would lose his heart at the party but he was destined to lose-it– irrecoverably lose it. \n\n\n        The gentleman assisted his wife and daughter out of the carriage and as Jack was there to care for the horses he proceeded to the house at once where he was warmly welcomed. \n\n\n        “How are you Mr and Mrs. Beverly?” asked Sou Sowers as he shook the old gentleman’s hand. Sowers trembled all over. \n\n\n        “I am well thank you Mr Sowers how are you?” inquired Mr. Beverly. \n\n\n        Sowers asserted that they were all well. and then came the introductions. Hugh was the last one introduced and the last one he was introduced to was Musadora Beverly– Mr. Beverly’s daughter. Hugh’s heart was gone then for the beauti beautiful young lady before him took his heart captive and it was to be a never-ending captivity. The darkness came on. other guests arrived. Mrs, Barton and also Wilse. \n\n\n[PAGE 384: SC0313_Ms_365]\n\n\n-many others arrived whose names are too tedious to mention. Kent had not made his appearance yet. The two parlors were made one and they were brilliantly illuminated. \n\n\n        The servants were in attendance and everything was going on nicely when a horrified scream broke the dull monotonous monotonous roar of the creek. \n\n\n        The guests as well as the host were astounded. What did it all mean? No one could tell. Finally there was a thumping  at the front door[,] and one of the servants opened it and was astonished at the sight that met there gaze for there stood a son of Erin with the motionless form of a girl in his arms. \n\n\n        The master was immediately informed of the state of affairs and every one of the guests came out on the porch to see. the sight. What was Doctor Maltby’s surprise when he recognized the Irishman to be his informant– the man that informed him of the existence of his long lost love. “Who have you got there. Pat” asked he eagerly.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII\n[PAGE 385: SC0313_Ms_366]\n\n\n        “Faith doctor I have an intended assassin” answered Pat “I caught this bonny girleen in front of the parlor window. she had a pistol levelled at one of the ladies’ head as shure as you’re born she did.”\n\n\n        “Who is She Pat?” inquired the doctor, then turning to the host he said: “I am slightly acquainted with this man —” pointing to Pat — “And I beleive he means some good by coming here tonight, who is the girl?”\n\n\n        “I’ll bring her to the light so as ye can see who she is. how can I tell?” grunted Pat as he carried his burthen into the hall. Mrs. Barton looked upon the pale face of the girl and started back aghast, unable to speak a word for some moments. finally she exclaimed:\n\n\n        “My goodness It is Kate! and She holds in her hand a large pistol! the pistol that once belonged to your my husband I condemn her myself. she is the one that tried to kill Mattie.”\n\n\n[PAGE 386: SC0313_Ms_367]\n\n\n        It was Kate. She still lay unconscious on the floor in the hall — while they are trying to restore her to consciousness we will enlighten our Readers upon the subject of Kate’s non-appearance at the party that night. She had been invited to the party but strange to say — declined the invitation well — we will not convict her but let her Speak for herself — and as she is fast regaining consciousness we will investigate her case at once. Kate opened her eyes and stared wildly around for some moments then she muttered: “My God! I am caught at last. caught with the pistol in my hand — Eh? Yes I have it yet. I will kill myself at once” as she spoke the words she raised the pistol and pointed it at the lookers on so as to keep them at bay. It must be understood also that she said the above words in a low voice. but Pat heard her — — and after she had made the lookers on stand away a pace or two further. She pointed the pistol toward [Crossed out word] her head and was only prevented from shooting\n\n\n[PAGE 387: SC0313_Ms_368]\n\n\nherself by the timely interference of Pat!\n\n\n        “Would ye destroy yersel, b ^(me) bonny girleen?” asked he as he wrested the weapon from her “Oh no, ye must hev a hearin’ afore the court of justice before ye depart hence.” Kate arose from the floor. desperation was depicted upon her countenance.\n\n\n        “Now me girleen confess yer deeds” said Pat. \n\n\n        “I am caught. driven to desperation, so I will confess all.” said Kate.\n\n\n        “Bring her into the parlor and we will listen to her” said Sowers as he suited action to his word by leading the way into the parlor himself. Kate walked bravely into the parlor. Pat following close behind. reaching the parlor Kate said:\n\n\n        “I am now ready to confess — to make a full confession of all I have done to Spoil the peace of Brookland — also to exonerate Albert King from all blame in regard to attempting to kill Mattie for I feel it my duty to do so.”\n\n\n[PAGE 388: SC0313_Ms_369]\n\n\n        “If yer fale it yer duty to do so ye had bether do so.” said Pat in a mocking voice.\n\n\n        “I came here a great deal during last winter.” resumed Kate, not paying any heed to Pat’s mocking, sarcastic [crossed out letter] words. “And as I were always very fast I got insulted at the cool way in which I was entertained so I vowed I would have vengeance. I began my avenging as I called it on sunday for I assisted Albert King to get William Reed’s clothes. I loved — and do love William Reed. I made a compact with Albert King he was to do all he could to win Ella away from William and I would do all I could to win William — well that has nothing to do with my revenge for being insulted — on Monday night second of April I went to bed early — very early but mother sat up conversing with Wilson Reed mother went to her room about ten o’clock o’clock. I layed very still in my room until I thought she had gone to sleep, then I got up and put on a suit of miller’s clothes — the suit belonged to Wiliam. I went out of the house quietly and came up here to this\n\n\n[PAGE 389: SC0313_Ms_370]\n\n\nhouse. I soon gained accession to Mattie’s room and hid before she came in. I waited until she was sound asleep and then proceeded to her bed, intending to kill her for the cool treatment I had received that day.\n\n\n        “As I raised the knife Mattie opened her eyes and gave a loud scream, her scream unnerved me and I could not do what I intended at first, but I did my best to kill her and in in fact I thought I had. I knew Abert[gc] would be suspected so I was very well satisfied. I came up here on the next day and was very sorry I found her alive. such was my deadly hate. I then resolved to try something else. Then I became desperate and intended to risk all to win William. So I resolved resolved to do my best to kill Ella for what could Al do when he was suspected of attempting to kill Mattie? I resolved thus with myself so I got this very pistol one night in the same week that I stabbed\n\n\n[PAGE 390: SC0313_Ms_371]\n\n\n        Mattie and watching an opportunity I slipped up here and tried to kill Ella but did not succeed so time wore on and tonight I thought I would t try and see if I could kill Ella. just as I had levelled my pistol at her head this old Irishman grabbed me and so that winds up my career on earth. I ask forgiveness of no one for I do not deserve any forgiveness whatever.”\n\n\nEvery one present was awe-struck.\n\n\n“I forgive you Kate although you do not ask it. I forgive you.” said Ella, as soon as she could find voice to speak. Mattie looked steadily at Kate for some moments in silence. \n\n\n“I forgive you too Kate” said Mattie. “I hope you may be a better girl hereafter.”\n\n\nKate looked at the two young ladies in surprise, then a melancholy look came over her features as she remembered how wicked she had been. “My hereafter is not in this world.” the words fell desperately from, her lips “I am through with this world and want to get out of it. I have nothing to live for so I will and must die!”\n\n\n[PAGE 391: SC0313_Ms_372]\n\n\n        As she spoke the last words she made a desperate lunge at Pat and tried to wrest the pistol from his hand but the wily son of the Emerald Isle proved to be too powerful an antagonist for her so she was compelled to relinquish the idea of entering the hereafter for a while at least “ah no me bonny lassie you can’t do that” said Pat as he caught both her hands in an ice like grip in his own.\n\n\n        One thing was remarkable about ou our son of Erin; his face was so soft and white that he did not much resemble an Irishman but he had on the inevitable green.\n\n\n        “Well Pat where did you come from?” inquired Sowers as soon as Kate was under control and general quietness reigned supreme. Are you just from Erin-go-bragh?“\n\n\n        “Faith no. I am from New England that gentleman knows me.” said Pat, ponting to Doctor Maltby “I heve been to see him several times at his office.”\n\n\n[PAGE 392: SC0313_Ms_373]\n\n\n        “Yes I am acquainted with Pat” asserted the doctor and “And Pat” said he turning to, and, addressing that individual — “Pat I wish to speak to you in private — come out on the porch a moment.”\n\n\n        The doctor started but Pat said: “Not jes’ yet doctor, I must fix this young lassie comfortably, so as she can enjoy the party. I heve somethin’ more to say to her afther ‘while if she will only be quiet an’ listen”\n\n\n        “I do not wish to hear anything at all.” said Kate, a desperate gleam in her eyes.\n\n\n        “Yes but ye must heer someth somethin’.” muttered Pat as he lead her to the furthest cornere of the room — the furthest from the door which lead out into the hall.\n\n\n        “I tell you I don’t want to hear anything” protested Kate. “I don’t want to live.”\n\n\n        “Ye don’t want to hear anything and don’t want to live” repeated Pat. “Well I will not tire your pashunce wid tellin’ you anythin’ but I will tell you some one thing that will interest you.”\n\n\n[PAGE 393: SC0313_Ms_374]\n\n\n        Although Kate was “desperate” and “didn’t want to live.” Pat’s words aroused and excited her curiosity to the highest pitch. Women in general have great curiosity — especially for investigating and revealing secrets, and Kate was not and an exception to the general rule. her eyes brightened at hearing Pat’s words.\n\n\n        “Well tell me now if you are going to.” said Kate sullenly. “although I am not caring whether I hear you or not.”\n\n\n        “Oh me lassie you can sit there awhile first” said Pat. “Yer are nervous now an’ It won’t do to excite you too much.” Then turning to the “docther” Pat said: “Come on docther I want to speak to ye.” The doctor followed without a word.\n\n\n        While they are going we will employ ourselves by making a few casual remarks in regard to our characters.\n\n\n        Kate sat there in the corner of the room looking very sullen. Mrs. Beverly thinking\n\n\n[PAGE 394: SC0313_Ms_375]\n\n\nit was time to terminate the silence said: “That doctor’s name is Maltby didn’t you say Mr Sowers?” she turned inquiringly to him sowers. Sowers started up as if awakened from by a vivid dream. \n\n\n        “Yes madam his name is Maltby” said sowers “He has been here a long long while.”\n\n\nThe lady looked dissappointed but she continued in an anxious voice: “What is the other part of his name? does any of you know?” queried she.\n\n\n“Indeed we do not” said sowers speaking for all. “We have always called him doctor, and he has never told us any other name but except Maltby in fact I never thought of his name until you mentioned.”\n\n\nThere was a short silence.\n\n\n“Where is Mr. Kent? Mr. Sowers?” inquired Mr Beverly “I have not seen him yet. I thought at first perhaps he was out doors somewhere and would soon return.”\n\n\n“I am not able to say where Mr Kent is.” answered sowers. “He often goes off in that way but I didnt think he would\n\n\n[PAGE 395: SC0313_Ms_376]\n\n\ndo so this evening, as he knew you were coming, and he seems to think a great deal of you for he talks often of Mr an Mrs Beverly and daughter I guess he will be in before a great while.”\n\n\n        Ella and Mattie were entertaining their new acquaintances to the best of their ability also casting an occasional glance at Kate, the schemer, avenger, and and would-be — “felo-de-se-”.\n\n\n        Herbert, Hugh, William, and Albert were also conversing in low tones. other guests began to arrive, and the two parlors were separated — the one for the young people and the other for the settled ones for none were very old. As Pat and the doctor have reached the porch we will listen to hear what they have to say “in private.”\n\n\n        “Well my man. What news?” inquired the doctor “have you brought me good news?”\n\n\n        “I have indade sur I have brought you joyful intilligince” answered Pat jubilantly.\n\n\n[PAGE 396: SC0313_Ms_377]\n\n\n        “Docther ye jes go in and as they heve separated the parlors, you get Wilse Reed. Mrs. Barton, Kate, Mr. sowers, Mrs. sowers and darter, also meister Beverly, wife and darter and Mrs. King and son get them in one room to themselves thin I will tell ye a tale.” the doctor hardly waited for Pat to complete his order before he was in the parlor, his task was easily completed — in fact all the persons Pat had named were in there except Mattie and William. The doctor called Pat and that individual quickly responded.\n\n\n        He walked w into the middle of the room, a smile of satisfaction upon his face. he gazed leisurely around as if to assure himself that they were all there. after gazing to his satisfaction he quietly locked the door. sowers protested but was quieted by the doctor. Pat walked again to the middle of the room and pointing unmistak unmistakably at Mrs. Beverly he said:\n\n\n        “Doctor William Maltby there is your long lost sister!”\n\n\nChapter XXXIV\n[PAGE 397: SC0313_Ms_378]\n\n\n        Doctor. Maltby. was sitting in a chair directly opposite Mrs. Beverly. as Pat spoke the doctor rose from his seat, clasped his hands to his temples and staggered like a drunken man. he staggered near Mrs. Beverly: \n\n\n        “Great Heaven! This my sister!” said he staring wildly at Mrs. Beverly. “Can I beleive my ears?”\n\n\n        “Yes you can dear brother!” cried Mrs. Beverly as she grasped her brother and fairly smothered him with her kisses “I am your sister Dora! your long lost sister! Oh brother William how happy I am! how glad I am that I have at last met you!” \n\n\n        “United at last! Thank God!” exclaimed the doctor. “I knew you you had married this man but I took no notice of the name tonight. Pat– god bless him– told me you married a man named Beverly.”\n\n\n        “Yes brother I married him. he is a noble man.” said Mrs. Beverly in an undertone. “I will tell you sometime of my hardships after you left me. for the present I must forbe\n\n\n[PAGE 398: SC0313_Ms_379]\n\n\nforbear. Let me introduce you to my husband.” said she as she with her brother walked over to where Mr. Beverly sat. “Mr. John. S. Beverly, this is my brother William.” said Mrs. Beverly proudly: \n\n\n        “I am happy to make your acquaintance Mr. Maltby how have you been?” said Mr Beverly with a low bow as he extended his hand to this brotherinlaw[gd]. \n\n\n        “I have been well thank you.” said the doctor. “I hope you have been well.”\n\n\n        Before any other words were said. Mrs. King attracted attention by saying distractedly: “John. S. Beverly? Why my name was Rebecca. Beverly. before I was married and I had a brother named John. S. Beverly. Can that be my brother?”\n\n\n        She said the words as if to herself. She looked in Mr. Beverly’s face inquiringly. he returned the look with interest. \n\n\n        “Your name Rebecca, Beverly before you were married” inquired he anxiously: \n\n\n        “The same” cried Mrs King. “And I know you are my long lost brother!” added She\n\n\n[PAGE 399: SC0313_Ms_380]\n\n\nas she bounded forward and fell into his arms! “Oh John how glad I am to see you my dear dear brother” murmured she. as she was clasped in his arms in a strong and loving embrace. \n\n\n        “Sister here is the little chain you gave me before you ran away.” said Mr. Beverly producing a small gold chain which was attached to his watchgaurd. “I have kept that chain all this time. hoping to find the donor” added Mr Beverly. “Tell me sister where have you been so long?”\n\n\n        “I have been here at Winchester for a good long while. but we will talk of that when a more suitable time comes.” said Mrs King “I want to hear your story first. that young lady is your daughter.” said Mrs. King indicating. Musadora. Beverly. “How like myself when I were young. I must have a kiss from here ” Mrs King suited action to her words by going over to where the young lady sat and kissing her plump cheeks.\n\n\n[PAGE 400: SC0313_Ms_381]\n\n\n        “My own dear niece.” said Mrs. King. \n\n\n        “Oh, dear aunt how glad I am to see you” said the young lady, whom we will call Dora “for short” “Father has looked for you so long, so long, but he said he would never give over the hope of finding you.”\n\n\n        “I knew John would hunt the world over for me” said Mrs. King. “Now I must give you an introduction to my son Albert” added she as she led her neice to Albert “Albert this is your cousin Dora” said Mrs. King. \n\n\n        “I am very glad to find ^(you) a cousin when I thought you were a stranger” said Albert extending his hand. he was surprised when the beautiful girl gave him a kiss. \n\n\n        “I am so glad to find you a cousin dear Albert” said She. They sat down an conversed upon the subject which was of interest to them viz: of their joy at finding relatives among strangers. William, Kent, Wilson, and Sowers sat mute with wonder. Was the world drawing to a close?  Oh no that could not be possible. Well what was the matter? The question could-not be answered. \n\n\n[PAGE 401: SC0313_Ms_382]\n\n\nSowers was trembling. he had known this gentleman. many years and had— \n\n\n        The thought was too bad, and now he sat every moment to be condemned. Pat cast a mischievous look at sowers, as if to say “your time nixt ould boy.”\n\n\n        Mrs. Barton turned very pale when she heard Doctor Maltby’s first name called. Pat took notice of it and as soon as he got an opportunity to speak he said as he pointed to the doctor: \n\n\n        “Miss. Jennie. Baker. There is William Maltby yer long lost lover. There he stands. look on his watch-gaurd and ye will see yer own picter in a nice little frame. go and—” \n\n\n        Pat did not finish his sentence for the doctor finished it in action. \n\n\n        “Jennie Baker did you say? Why that was my betrothed’s name. yes this is here for I can -not for  but remember those eyes” asserted the doctor. “I am William Maltby. come to me my long lost love!” the doctor ran forward and threw his arms around Mrs. Barton. \n\n\n[PAGE 402: SC0313_Ms_383]\n\n\n        Mrs. Barton disengaged herself from his the doctor’s embrace as quickly as possible. \n\n\n        “I love you William. Maltby but I can’t allow you such liberty while my husband lives” said Mrs. Barton. “My husband still lives. William. and I must not perjure myself. but I love you. Oh so much!”\n\n\n        “Where is your husband dearest Jennie? Where can he be? Oh I will go mad” muttered the doctor. “Can you not get a divorce? but where is he Ohe do tell me!” \n\n\n        Mrs. Barton, as we still choose to call her pointed toward Wilse. Reed. \n\n\n        “There is my husband!” said she in a sepulchral voice. Before she could speak another word Pat stepped forward and said: “Doctor I can explain this mystery.  That man– the husband of that lady is an escaped convict from the—”\n\n\nWilse was on Pat before he could finish the sentence. “I’ll murder you you infernal devil” said Will Wilse. he tried to hold Pat down but he could not do it. Pat rose with his antagonist and with a quick movement\n\n\n[PAGE 403: SC0313_Ms_384]\n\n\nhe clapped Wilse Reed’s hands together and slipped a pair of bracelets on him— government bracelets. \n\n\n        “There ye spalpeen ye.” said Pat as soon as he had got Wilse hand-cuffed. “I reckon ye wonder where i got those bracelets– well I brought them here on purpose to make you a present of them, and you want to raise the divil about it. you ugly spalpeen ye” then turning to the doctor he said:  “I will go on with my story; this lady married this spalpeen under the name of Matthew Barton well that is a false name and so is Wilse Reed. the dirty rascal’s right name is Fred. Lambert. the same as I tould ye up at yer office not long since. he always was a highwayman and he has carried a plot through with another man– carried it successfully through for a good many years. he is a capital rascal”\n\n\n        “Kate then is his daughter?” said the doctor enquiringly. Looking at Pat. \n\n\n        Mrs. Barton— or more properly– Miss Baker spoke for Pat instead of Pat. \n\n\n[PAGE 404: SC0313_Ms_385]\n\n\n        “Kate is the daughter of his first wife” said Miss Baker. for we have no right to call her Mrs. Barton since we have found that, that isn’t her name. William. was astounded then sure enough. “Why father you are not what you said you were” said William. “And I beg you to tell me truly who are my parents?  others are finding their relatives when they were not expecting it. So  I want to find my true ones if you please.”\n\n\n        “You can easily do that.” said Wilse calmly. Sowers tried to stop Wilse from saying anything but Wilse was determined to tell all. \n\n\n        “I am not your father. Mr. John. Beverly. is your father you are his oldest son. I know that. and so I had as well make a full confession of all i have done to keep you from your parents: Mr. Sowers there was a lover of Mrs. Beverly’s when she was very young, pretty soon after Doctor Maltby went away well Sowers got drunk and insulted her so she gave him the “sack” he vowed vengeance to her at some future time. I met him the very day she sacked him\n\n\n[PAGE 405: SC0313_Ms_386]\n\n\nand he made himself acquainted with me and got me to be his accomplice in his vengeance of Mrs. Beverly. I was going then by my right name Fred. Lambert. but I changed my name at once to Wilse Reed as soon as I saw Sowers’ purpose. his first plan—”\n        Sowers had sprawled Wilse Reed on the floor with a chair. “Lay there you infamous liar!” said Sowers. he was going to give Wilse another crack on the head with the chair if Pat had not interposed. \n\n\n        “He is telling the truth Mister Sowers” said Pat. “And ye must let him tell.”\n\n\n        “I’ll not be misrepresented in this style in my own house before strangers!” thundered Sowers fairly boiling with rage “I’ll put you out of here as well as Wilse. You blasted Iris Irish devil!”\n\n\n        “Be azy now or I’ll put you out mister Sowers” said Pat cooly. Sowers was spoiling all the “fun” by his interference. \n\n\nIt was a lively party\n\n\n[PAGE 406: SC0313_Ms_387]\n\n\n        Wilse. Reed. as we shall continue to call him had been knocked senseless but being of a strong nature he soon rallied. \n\n\n        “I am more determined than ever to expose you” said Wilse as Pat assisted him to his seat “I’ll tell all if it sends me to the gallows the moment after I finish;  his first plan was to kill Mr. Beverly but he couldn’t get that done so easily, so he abided his time for another plan, When miss Maltby and Mr. Beverly were married he with my assistance was to capture her and he would maker her his wife he was not worthy of here . I knew that but I was making money so I didn’t care what became of Sowers or his bride. he could not get that plan through so he resolved upon another—”\n\n\n        “I’ll shoot you if you say another word you infamous liar” Sowers said, again interrupting Wilse “Every word you speak is a lie except about the loving of Dora Maltby. any person would love her then turning to Mrs. Sowers he said:  “Mary I have deceived you all my life time with you”\n\n\n[PAGE 407: SC0313_Ms_388]\n\n\n        “You have deceived me? Oh god!” said Mrs. Sowers, and she fell over in a dead faint. Cold water was brought and her temples were bathed. Mattie was mystified what could all this mean? Was her father mad? Why was the doors locked? Who was this son of Erin?  how did he find out so much? a thousand questions presented themselves in a hundred different ways but she could not answer them they were too hard for her, William was interested in his own history as given by then man that had always called himself his father. \n\n\n        Albert was still sitting beside his lovely cousin. the middle doors were thrown open so as all the guests could be together for the noise in the back parlor had already excited the curiosity of the ladies in the front. \n\n\n        William was eager to hear Wilse’s story. \n\n\n        “Where is Kent I’d like to know.” whispered William to Ella. “I can’t think\n\n\n[PAGE 408: SC0313_Ms_389]\n\n\n        Where he can be for my life!”\n\n\n        “Well I dont know I am sure” replied Ella. “Isn’t this a great pleasure party?”\n\n\n        “Yes it is and I expect to get my true name before this party comes to a close.”answered William. “Ah Mrs. Sowers is coming around at last. poor woman she has a vile husband I am afraid, for Wilson has told the truth I do beleive.”\n\n\n        Mrs. Sowers was at last restored to consciousness. She sat up and looked bewildered for awhile. finally she with the assistance of Miss, Baker, went to the large sofa and sat down. \n\n\n        “Deceived deceived” was all she muttered. \n\n\n        Pat thought it was time to start Wilse again. he accordingly said:\n\n\n        “Proceed Mr. Lambert I will keep your Mister Sowers from trying to steal your bracelets. I will give him a pair if he dont stop his foolishness,” Pat looked at Sowers as he spoke. Sowers gave him a defiant look— “Proceed” said Pat again. “Proceed with yer story”\nChapter XXXV\n[PAGE 409: SC0313_Ms_390]        \n\n\n“I’ll do so at once.” said Wilse. “I am determined to expose sowers if it costs me my life,” added he, with a malicious look. “I said he resolved upon another plan; or at least I intended to say so. His other plan was to steal their first child. He made that plan when Mrs. Beverly’s child was about two years of age; well I hired myself to him to help him, carry out his plan. one year was spent in trying to steal the child. sowers was married then for he got married about a year after Mrs. Beverly did. at the end of one year of treacherous manuoevering. on a summer evening I with sowers went along the road near where Mrs. Beverly lived. We saw on the left-hand-side of the road Mrs. Beverly’s nurse. the nurse had little Willie by the hand. she went through a gate that lead into a woods near by, as soon as she was lost from sight in the wood I said: ‘Now is your time sowers”\n\n\n        “It is by Jove Wilse” said sowers to me I\n\n\n[PAGE 410: SC0313_Ms_391]\n\n\nalways went by the name of Wilse Reed when with sowers. We turned and went after the nurse. Sowers had a drug in his pocket that he was going to give the child to put him to sleep until we could get away with it. away up in the woods we saw the girl sitting near a large tree talking to the little boy. we crept along slowly until we got to the tree. sowers had a large stick in his hand as soon as he got within striking distance of the girl he raised the club and dealt the her a stunning blow on the head. he then turned his attention to the child. the child screamed and hollowed so that I advised sowers to administer the drug at once. he administered it. the drug if administered rightly would keep the child asleep twelve hours. well he had about eight doses. he made a mistake and gave the child all of them. the child at once fell fast asleep. sowers laid the child near the nurse and as the nurse was beginning to stir we went away as quick as possible, we wandered around. sowers went to his\n\n\n[PAGE 411: SC0313_Ms_392]\n\n\nhouse and got a shot-gun. we then went over to Mrs. Beverly’s and persuaded him to go out hunting he went with us.\n\n\n        We took care to go in the direction of the girl; or at least where we left her, we were not afraid of being recognized for the girl didn’t see us when we first saw her. Mr. Beverly was the first to see his child he called us we came an was greatly surprised (?) to find the nurse an and child both laying senseless. sowers even shed a few tears.”\n\n\nWilse hesitated for he was out of breath. “Must I go on?” inquired he of sowers.\n\n\n“Yes tell all now for you have already exposed my treachery.” said sowers. “No, I will tell the rest myself.” continued sowers driven to desperation. he advanced to the middle of the room, directly in front of the centre table if it has a front. anyway he was in front of the majority of the “audience.”\n\n\nHe looked as solemn as a preacher when about to take his text. He glanced around\n\n\n[PAGE 412: SC0313_Ms_393]\n\n\nthe room to see if there was one pitying eye gazing at him. alas there was none unless it was his wife and daughter. must he look at them? yes he would look though he dreaded to do so for fear they too had dismissed all feeling of pity — from their minds — for him. he looked at his wife. did she look like she pitied him? yes. for if she did not. why those silent tears? he glanced at his daughter ah yes she pitied him and loved him too. well he concluded he would begin;\n\n\n        “I have been a bad bad man in my younger days.” began sowers as if he were going to make a speech. “My indiscretion in my young days has caused me a whole lifetime of sin. yes I shed tears but they were tears of joy I was so glad I had at last avenged myself of on Mrs. Beverly. Mr, Beverly with Wilse and myself went to the house. The nurse had recovered consciousness and she went to the house with us. she could not tell who di did the dastardly treacherous deed.\n\n\n        “The doctor was sent for. he said he could do no good, so the child was given up for\n\n\n[PAGE 413: SC0313_Ms_394]\n\n\ndead. Preparations were made for the burial which was to take place on sunday, this being Friday.

I was sexton of that grave yard at that time. look at me and see for yourself who I am”\nas the apparent son of Erin said this he took of the last part of clothing that disguised him, and stood tall and towering in their midst as David Kent! Every one in the room was mute with wonder. Mr. Beverly recognized Kent before he had taken off all his disguise. he arose and taking Kent by the hand he said:\n\n\n        “I am surprised at you Mr. Kent. you are playing quite an interesting peice.” \n\n\n        “I am indeed!” said Kent.\n\n\n        “Why Mr. Kent are you the Irishman that visited my office two or three times?” inquired Dr. Maltby.\n\n\n        “I am the identical Pat” answered Kent “Here is a card with my full name on it” added he, producing a card on which his name was written in full.\n\n\n        “David Patterson Kent” read the doctor. “you are a keen man Mr. Kent. I didn’t once dream it was you who told me so much\n\n\n[PAGE 415: SC0313_Ms_396]\n\n\nabout my sister and Miss Baker.”\n\n\n        “I am the man” said Kent. “But let’s to business. I told sowers he should know and he shall. I soon recovered from the faint but said nothing to anybody about this grave-robbery. I was satisfied that the child was still alive so I abided my time. now Mr. Lambert I want you to finish the story. Mr. sowers you may sit down. proceed Fred proceed at once.”\n \n        “I’ll tell no more unless you take those blasted handicuffs off” said Wilse.\n\n\n        “Well I’ll take them off if you’ll behave and tell the story as it goes” assented Kent as he loosened the “bracelets.”\n\n\n        “Now I’ll tell all I know.” said Wilse. “I’ll condemn myself as well. I took the child and as I hadn’t been long married I took it to my wife’s house — my second wife. Miss Baker. — Kate’s mother was my first wife well when I got married the second time I told my wife that I had two children\n\n\n[PAGE 416: SC0313_Ms_397]\n\n\na girl and boy of mine that I intende intended bringing home she consented so I took little Willie and Kate to my new home. two weeks after I took them there I got into a difficulty about some one being murdered and one month from date I was in the Massachusetts State’s Prison for life.

If you want further proofs of his identity you must compel\n\n\n[PAGE 417: SC0313_Ms_398]\n\n\nMr. sowers to take you to his private, office he has all the necessary proofs there.”\n\n\n        “I want proof” said Mrs. Beverly. then turning to her h husband she said: “Oh John what bliss what bliss we will have if this is really our son! Mr. sowers I demand entrance to your private office at once!”\n\n\n        “Driven to desperation I will show you all that is in there! follow me.” said sowers as he left the room and proceeded to his private office. there to disclose a secret he had kept from his family for years and years. Every person in the parlor followed sowers to his office.\n\n\n        Kent kept an eye on Wilse, Reed, and Kate William was hoping against hope that Mr. and Mrs. Beverly were his parents.\n\n\n        Poor Mattie! she could not help shedding tears because of her father’s treachery. Herbert did all he could to soothe her.\n\n\n        “If your father was to die on the gallows a disgraced felon it would not change\n\n\n[PAGE 418: SC0313_Ms_399]\n\n\nme.” said Herbert soothingly, as he walked by Mattie’s side. in the rear of the other persons that were following sowers’ footsteps. \n\n\n        “I would love you all the same my dear, my love, my own.” added Herbert Byronically.\n\n\n        “I beleive you would dear Bertie.” asserted Mattie. “But I hate to see father humbled so. I did not beleive him to be such a wicked man. Oh Bertie! if I hadn’t your steadfast love to uphold me and encourag[ge] me I would not be able to stand this”\n\n\n        “Bear up dear Mattie. Bear up dont be discouraged your father will be forgiven” soothed Herbert “We will all move to New England soon where it will not be known so your father nor you my dear will not be disgraced oh! darling how I long for the time to come when I can call you realy really mine. then I will sheild you from all harm or lose my life in the attempt!” \n\n\n        This conversation was carried on in such a low tone that no one heard Herbert’s words but the one he intended to hear should hear them.\n\n\n[PAGE 419: SC0313_Ms_400]\n\n\n        Sowers reached his office. opened the door and walked in. he trembled all over as if he had the palsy.\n\n\n“Oh if this life of mine was ended I would be glad!” said he to himself. “ah no I would have no peace in the grave I have been too sinful!”\n\n\n        He inserted the key in the lock in the desk. he hesitated. “must I open it?” the thought came to him involuntarily. The office was near the front door of the house. Kate was near the door and would have bounded out to try to escape but her curiosity was excited greatly.\n\n\nShe wanted to see what was in that private office. She was not thinking of the death she was to meet.\n\n\nNo! She was not thinking! she did not even dream of the terrible death she was doomed to meet. or she would have been preparing to meet it or to do something to avoid meeting it if such a thing were\n\n\n[PAGE 420: SC0313_Ms_401]\n\n\npossible. She had fixed her mind on a place of refuge. We will follow her when she goes. for the present we must pay strict attention to sowers.\n\n\nSowers stood for sometime debating as to whether he should open the desk or not. It was hard to let evey every one present see proofs — such damnable proofs of his treachery in former as well as latter years. “Mr. sowers are you going to open the desk or not?” It was Mrs. Beverly who spoke. she was tired waiting to see the proofs of William’s identity.\n\n\n“I will open it!” said sowers. and with that he unlocked the door of the desk and putting his hand in one of the pigeon holes he drew out a bundle of something. on top of the bundle lay a nice wreath it might have been a funeral wreath or it might have been a bridal wreath. We shall see. \n\n\n“Here are the necessary proofs” said sowers displaying the contents of the bundle after untying it. “All necessary. proofs are here.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI\n[PAGE 421: SC0313_Ms_402]\n        Mrs. Beverly picked up the wreath. \n\n\n        She paled as she looked intently at the wreath for in the centre of the wreath were the words written in bold spencerian style: “In memory, of,: William, G; Beverly.”\n\n\n        Then followed a few verses of poetry which we we need not record. \n\n\n        “Mr. Beverly grasped it. could he beleive what he saw? No! It was too incredible to be believed! he examined the wreath more closely. \n\n\n        “It is the very wreath we had laid on our dear little Willie’s breast!”asserted Mr. Beverly. “The very wreath! Let me look at the other things.” He took up a pretty little dress– a dress suitable for a child of about three years. \n\n\n        “Dora this is Willie’s dress.” said he turning to his wife. “Sowers what have you done? robbed me of my child. and not trying to turn from your evil ways?”\n\n\n        “I am satisfied” said Sowers “I have had revenge. but it has been a miserable\n\n\n[PAGE 422: SC0313_Ms_403]\n\n\nrevenge! a miserable revenge,” added he “Those are the proofs that William is your son. I will swear it on God’s holy word.”\n\n\n        “William is really my son?”\n\n\n        “William is really your son.” said Sowers “Look at the resemblance between William and Albert. They look so near alike that a great many persons has often taken them to be brothers. I am telling the truth.”\n\n\n        “Thank God our son is still alive” Exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Beverly in one voice: “Yes this is our own dear Willie” said Mrs. Beverly as she embraced our hero. \n\n\n        “Those beautiful dark eyes tell’s the tale.” \n\n\n        “Mr. and Mrs. Beverly.” said Wilse. Reed— or more correctly speaking– Fred Lambert. \n\n\n        “I have raised your son well. He is the soul of honor and I want credit for it. Here is my daughter” continued he turning to Kate. “Kate we have not lived together much but we must die together. I will settle all of this at once. So as to make you all beleive for certain that I am Fred. Lambert I have\n\n\n[PAGE 423: SC0313_Ms_404]\n\n\nmy first wife’s certificate— our marriage certificate which I had written with invisible ink I will produce that. Then I consider my work on earth done.”\n\n\n        So saying he felt in his pocket for it. \n\n\n        “I have lost it,” said he after searching vainly for it. “I carried that cerf certificate a long while but I have lost it at last.”\n\n\n        “And I found it!” asserted Kent as he walked forward and handed a peice of parchment paper to Wilse. \n\n\n        It was the peice of paper he found at the ledge! Wilse showed it to every one in the room. William was standing near the door which lead out into the hall. Standing by his sister’s side conversing in low tones He was the last one that Wilse gave the paper to. Kate was also standing near the door as Wilse with one hand. handed this certificate to William, he with the other hand touched Kate on the shoulder\n\n\n        “Come my daughter come,” said Wilse\n\n\n[PAGE 424: SC0313_Ms_405]\n\n\n        We will not be prisoners any longer. We will go into the old mill. no one will pursue us thither” he spoke so low and so quickly, no one took notice of him. Kate heeded his words and before any one could step between them and the door they were out and gone. \n\n\n        Kent with several others of the gentlemen gave them chase but could not over-take them. for they had gotten good head-way When they caught sight of Wilse and Kate, Wilse had hold of Kate’s hand and was leading– nay dragging her through the water. The water ran very swift and It was a difficult task to get to the mill. The moon shone out bright for about fifteen minutes. Kent and the other gentlemen stood on the shore looking intently at Wilse and his daughter. \n        \n        At last the two fugitives reached the old mill. The water was already up to the second floor. The mill shook as the waters rushed by. now a large log would strike against the mill\n\n\n[PAGE 425: SC0313_Ms_406]\n\n\nand perhaps lodge there. Then fence rails, plank, brush, and a great many other loose articles too tedious to mention. \n\n\n        The gentlemen turned and walked slowly to the house, satisfied that Fred, and Kate Lambert had doomed themselves to inevitable destruction. \n\n\n        “That mill will wash away before morning if I judge aright” asserted Mr. Beverly. \n\n\n        “Yes it will” assented Kent. “Fred and Kate have willfully planned their own destruction to keep from being prisoners Mr. Beverly. I am confident. That you can’t fully express your joy in finding your son when you thought he was dead these many years.” continued Sowers Kent addressing Mr Beverly. “I knew that your son was taken out but never said anything about it for fear I would not be believed. however, I didn’t forget it. I watched and waited. Sowers moved away. but I could not ascertain where\n\n\n[PAGE 420: SC0313_Ms_407]\n\n\nhe moved to. I got an obtained a situation as government secret service officer and I can tell you I ferreted out every den in Newyork City. I soon obtained the name of the ‘Blood-hound-detective.’ I still kept this graveyard business in my mind. years passed away. I was at last rewarded for my long watchfulness by receiving an order from the cheif to come up here as this gentleman wanted a detective. I saw the signature: ‘Joshua. Sowers.’ I was satisfied so I came at once with the result you have already seen.”\n\n\n        “I am overjoyed at finding my son.” said Mr. Beverly. “Words cannot express my joy. my wife has been in comparatively bad health ever since we found him in the wood. I am willing to forgive Mr. Sowers for what he has done. he wasn’t treacherous enough to kill my child, so Mr. Sowers.” turning to Sowers and extending his hand. \n\n\n        “I forgive you and I trust we shall always be as good friends as we are now. Mr. Kent you shall receive a large reward\n\n\n[PAGE 427: SC0313_Ms_408]\n\n\nfor your services also.” continued Beverly. \n\n\n        “For finding and proving to me my sister, and also my child.”\n\n\n        They had reached the house by this time. \n\n\n        About half-past-ten-o’clock the guests began to depart. They said they had seen as good a performance as they would have seen had they been at a theatre. \n\n\n        Hugh. Walters went home too after asking Miss Beverly the privilege of visiting her. he was granted that privilege and started on his way home in company with his sister. his heart beating wildly, he went to bed soon after he reached home. in his sleep he dreamed of seeing Dora Beverly and himself standing at the altar, and being made one. \n\n\n        After all the strangers had left Brookland our characters began talking again upon the subject of William’s birth, also Mrs. King had a great deal to tell her brother. \n\n\n[PAGE 428: SC0313_Ms_409]\n\n\n        Miss Baker, alias Mrs. Barton sat still, she looked long and earnestly at her lover, doctor Maltby. tears trickled down her careworn cheeks. all present had been relieved of their burthen except her. She was still bound to a man with two or three aliases. Mr. Lambert, alias, Barton, alias, Reed he was a felon, a murderer. Still she considered herself bound to him by a sacred tie. \n\n\n        Doctor Maltby glanced at Miss Baker. he saw the tears trickling down her cheeks.\n\n\n        “Oh Jennie if I could only see you happy I would also be happy. as it is I can know no peace” said the doctor. \n\n\n        “I can have no peace on earth” responded Miss Baker. “The man I married has blighted my fondest hopes. Oh God! Would that I were in my grave!”\n\n\n        “Jennie. please dont say that” pleaded the doctor drawing nearer to Miss Baker. “Why did you marry this man? did you forget your promise to me? Oh no you could not forget it but why hesitate? Tell me\n\n\n[PAGE 429: SC0313_Ms_410]\n\n\nall. did you marry him for love?”\n\n\n        “I did not” said Miss Baker. “He did a great deal for my mother, and on her death bed she asked me if I would marry this man. She told me it was her wish that I should marry him. I consented and my poor mother died happy, little thinking I did not marry him for love.”\n\n\n        “God be thanked for that” muttered the doctor fervently. “You did not forget me?”\n\n\n        “Oh William your words make me suffer so much more than I would if you would not speak!” said Miss Baker. “I could not forget you. I always loved you but I was determined to obey my mother’s last wish you don’t blame me do you?”\n\n\n        “Blame you! No darling”  said the doctor “I do not blame you for anything you have done. for I know your heart has ever been true to me. I will give Kent a princely reward for pointing you\n\n\n[PAGE 430: SC0313_Ms_411]\n\n\nout to me! Oh if you could only be mine my life would be an everlasting heaven to me” said the doctor passionately. \n\n\n        “Excuse my sudden out burst of feelings” said the doctor addressing the host. \n\n\n        “I am so glad I have found my sister and my only love, that I cannot restrain my passionate words. here is a sister I have looked so long for. I have found her at last; or at least Kent found her for me. Where have you been spending the summer sister?”\n\n\n        “We have spent the summer at the famous watering-place called. Rock-bridge, Alum. I suppose you know when we came to Winchester?”\n\n\n        “Yes I recollect.”  said the doctor. “I beg to be pardoned William” added he “I really forgot to hail you as my nephew. I am glad I have such a fine and honorable nephew” he shook hands with William then turning to Dora he said: \n\n\n        “I have also a beautiful neice. I ought to be very proud of her. give me your hand” she extended her hand– “And a kiss” added the \n\n\n[PAGE 431: SC0313_Ms_412] \n\n\ndoctor in a whisper. he received a warm kiss from the lips of Dora. Beverly. \n\n\n        “Thank you my dear little neice.” said the doctor approvingly. “That kiss is worth a thousand dollars to any man.”\n\n\n        “You are a great flatterer Uncle William” asserted Dora with a smile. “Well uncle I would like to know where you have been all this time. Ma didn’t tell me you were a doctor, or I should have taken notice of the name. as it was I took no notice whatever of the name as there are as many persons by the name of Maltby as by any other name.”\n\n\n        “I was not a doctor when I left home,” asserted the doctor. “But I somehow or other came to learn that proffe profession while out in the Wild west.”\n\n\n        “You have been out in the wild west then uncle, have you?”\n\n\n        “Yes i have wandered over all the plains of the far, far, west” replied the \n\n\n[PAGE 432: SC0313_Ms_413]\n\n\ndoctor. “I amassed a large fortune out there and as I have now found my sister and my only love I will retire from practice. and if I am so fortunate as to get Miss Baker for my wife” he whispered in Dora’s ear. “I will live happily the rest of my days on earth.”\n\n\n        After a few more words of love, consolation and hope. They agreed that it was bed-time. All went to bed, and to sleep. \n\n\n        Mrs. King stayed at Sowers’ that night in fact all that stayed till half-past ten, stayed all night at Brookland. William. Slept quietly. he was satisfied. he knew he had been the victim of a vile conspiracy from his infancy but he forgave all. as he was at last restored to his parents.\n\n\n        Brookland was still. nothing could be heard but the pattern of the rain as it had again began to fall– and the roar of the waters as they hurried on their eastward course. About midnight all were suddenly awakened from their sleep! \n\n\nChapter XXXVII\n[PAGE 433: SC0313_Ms_414]\n\n\nWhat waked them? the reader asks. We can tell you what waked them. A tremendous crash was heard, as of a large building falling into the water. It was the mill! It had stood as long as it could but the drift that was constantly crowding against it. and the dam breaking away the tremendous rush of water caused the old mill to totter reel and fall with a deafening crash. Fred and Kate Lambert had taken the mill as a refuge. Where was their refuge now? Hurled from its foundation and scattered over the broad expanse of waters.\n\n\n        The fugitives! Where were they? After going in the mill they sat down awhile on the first flooring they came to that was dry. Presently they went into the uppermost story of the mill. father and daughter soon went to sleep for the excitement that was created at Brookland that evening g wrought powerfully upon their nerves.\n\n\n[PAGE 434: SC0313_Ms_415]\n\n\n        They went to sleep little thinking it was their last sleep in this world.\n\n\n        They never waked to full consciousness again for when they were aroused from sleep it was only to be knocked senseless by a falling beam. Was that all? ah no! In their insensibility they fell as the mill fell, and the current carried them on eastward as if they were logs. William — our hero — was the first one wakened by the crash, and as Albert was sleeping in the same room. William called him:\n\n\n        “Albert! cousin Albert!” called William.\n\n\n        Oh how proud our hero felt to be lifted from mystery to find himself surrounded by relatives. The two young men rose hastily and dressed themselves. then they went down stairs and after “striking” a light they went down to the banks of the creek opposite the mill. They looked but saw no mill. after a shot stay they went back to the house. the water was running very high. The brookland people were astir early on the following morning. every eye was turned in the direction of the mill.\n\n\n[PAGE 435: SC0313_Ms_416]\n\n\n        Sowers felt uneasy he wanted to ask his wife and daughter’s forgiveness but didn’t know how to go about it. however, he was determined to ask them. Mattie came into the room where Sowers and his wife was. “Now it is my time”\n thought sowers. “I must ask their forgiveness now.”\n\n\n        “The old mill is gone father” said Mattie as she entered the room.\n\n\n        “Yes the old mill has washed away” asserted sowers, and his voice trembled. “The old mill is gone, and I suppose my evil genius was washed away with it. Mattie—” he took ma Mattie’s hand in his. “Mattie I have been a bad man will you forgive me?” The words were so plaint plaintive, they brought tears to Mattie’s s eyes.\n\n\n        “Forgive you?” inquired Mattie. “Why father you have never done anything to me to cause you to ask my forgiveness. what do you mean father?”\n\n\n        “I ask you forgiveness — you to forgive me for deceiving you so long” said Sowers.\n\n\n        “If that is all” said Mattie. “you have my forgiveness. I forgive all the injury you have done me. You have always been a kind father you have always treated me well. Why should do anything that would cause you misery?”\n\n\n        “Thank you daughter for your kind words”\n\n\n[PAGE 436: SC0313_Ms_417]\n\n\nsaid sowers as he repeatedly kissed his daughter. \n\n\n“Mary Will you forgive me?” inquired sowers turning to his wife with an anxious look.\n\n\n        She turned to him with a look neither anxious or loving but stern and hard. “Why did you deceive me?” inquired she, not regard his inquiry. “Why did you tell me so many falsehoods? I will consider matters before I forgive you. In the meantime, I wish you to say as few words to me as you can — dont speak to me unless you are obliged to do so.”\n\n\n        Sowers said no more after hearing this sentence. he rose and went hastily down stairs.\n\n\n        She had not been long in the parlor before Mr. Beverly and wife came in. Their son and daughter soon came in. also Mrs. King, Miss Baker and finally all the guests were seated in the parlor. then began the cons conversation in regard to the old mill.\n\n\n        “My school-mate, Fred Lambert is lost in the deep.” said Doctor, Maltby, “What an innocent boy he w once was. Why he wouldn’t kill a spider when he used to go to school. He has since then killed persons has he not?”\n\n\n        “He has.” said Kent who thought it his duty to answer the inquiry. “He confessed last night that he committed two murders. Oh he was a desperate villain. but we will forget him\n\n\n[PAGE 437: SC0313_Ms_418]\n\n\nnow as he has met with death. Death has overtaken him in his mad career. for he could not have lived, he nor his daughter could not live after the mill fell. Oh! What a terrible death to did die.”\n\n\n        “Yes it was a fearful death” asserted Mr. Beverly. “Poor fellow I am sorry he has met his death in that way. he has been so sinful though, retribution was sure to visit him when he least thought of it.”\n\n\n        “None of you didn’t get up but Albert and myself.” said William. “We went down to the bank and looked over to where the mill used to stand, but saw no mill. that was a little after midnight.” then turning [gf]Mrs. Beverly William said: “Mother I have not thought to ask you where your home is” How his heart beat with thankfulness to the great one as he uttered the word “mother” he was in a perfect ecstacy. “Where do you live when at home dear mother?” inquired he.\n\n\n        “In Boston my son.” said she. “your father keeps a large Commission House there, and we will be happy with the [gg]of having a son of our own to take interest in the affairs of the House. Oh son I hardly\n\n\n[PAGE 438: SC0313_Ms_419]\n\n\nknow how or in what way to try to thank the Great, creator for his mercy in sparing you to comfort my latter days. It was a kind providence that raised you from the grave and caused you to grow up the soul of honor! I have two children now instead of one. Willie you can’t imagine how proud I will be to see you helping father to attend to the affairs of the store.”\n\n\n        “Has father got a partner in the firm?” asked William as he gently stroked his mother’s silvery locks. he was happy in the thought of b being a help to his father.\n\n\n        “No he is carrying on business without a partner”. answered William’s sister who thought it time for her to say a few words to her new-found brother. “Willie you might go in to a copartnership with him. you and cousin. Albert.”\n\n\n        “With his permission.” said William. “I will take the affairs of the firm entirely upon myself. Albert and I can be Commission merchants. I have at least two-hundred-and-fifty thousand dollars deposited in one of the leading banks of Banks of Chicago. I have been away out west sister. have had desperate encounters with the redskins and a hard struggle to find g gold. I found it though, and now I am an independent man.”\n\n\n[PAGE 439: SC0313_Ms_420]\n\n\n“You are?” asked Dora in surprise. “Why I thought you were — were — poor.”\n\n\n        “You thought I was a gentleman in reduced circumstances” said William laughingly. “sister come and walk with me down the lane to the creek.” added William then in a Whisper he said as she rose to go with him: “I have a revelation to make to you”\n\n\n        They walked down the lane. William talking and laughing all the time. But not until he stopped on the banks of the creek did he speak of the revelation he intended to make. after gazing into the whirling water for sometime William said: “sister the revelation of which I spoke is simply this; I love Miss. Ella, Armstead. and intend some day to make her my wife. now tell me sister, are you favorably impressed in regard to this young lady!”\n\n\n        “I think dear Willie that she is the kindest, most cheerful and perfect young lady I ever met with.” said Dara. “I would like to see her your wife. as for the revelation, you have that to make yet for I was already fully cognizant of the fact that you loved her by the affectionate way in which you always\n\n\n[PAGE 440: SC0313_Ms_421]\n\n\nspoke to her. now I will ask you a question and I want you to answer it if you please. Who is Hugh Walters? is he as much of a gentleman as he seems?”\n\n\n        “All I can say in regard to Hugh is that he is a gentleman in every sense of the word,” answered William truthfully. “Why do you ask that question Sister?”\n\n\n        “Oh — well — just for curiosity.” stammered Dora a little taken aback by this unexpected question. “I think he is a kind-hearted young man. and he is so full of fun.”\n\n\n        “Yes he always is.” asserted William. “Well there is Bertie, Armstead. what do you think of him? But hold on. for fear you may fall in love with him I will inform you of the fact that he is engaged to Mattie sowers. by-the-way how do you like her?”\n\n\n        “To answer your first question.” said Dara. “I will say that Bertie is certainly a nice young man. as for me falling in love with him you need not fear of any harm resulting from that. Mattie is a very agreeable young lady. I feel sorry for her because of her father’s treachery in years past. I forgive him for keeping my brother away from me don’t you dear brother?” inquired Dora in conclusion.\n\n\n        “Yes indeed. I hold no malice against him\n\n\n[PAGE 441: SC0313_Ms_422]\n\n\nwhatever.” answered William as he with his sister’s arm locked in his walked leisurely up to the house. breakfast was ready when they reached the house. So they sat down to enjoy the repast repast. After breakfast Mr. Beverly prepared to start for W Winchester. That day was a cloudy cheerless one, like it’s predecessor.\n\n\n        William went to town with his relatives, including the doctor, Mrs. King, and Albert. He spent a pleasant day with them, returned home in the evening resolved to ask Ella to become his wife as he had now found his real name. he wanted the day named and also Mr. and Mrs. Armstead’s consent.\n\n\n        Mr. and Mrs. Armstead stayed at Brookland all that day and intended to stay until Monday morning. After supper was over, William to his great joy got a chance to speak to Ella in private. They were sitting in the back parlor — no one was in the room but the two lovers.\n\n\n        “Ella.” said William as he drew nearer to his lady-love. “Ella I have at last attained to my right name. have you ever thought of my promise to you when I first declared my love?”\n\n\n        “Yes I have often thought of it” answered Ella. “Your promise has often cheered my th\n\n\n[PAGE 442: SC0313_Ms_423]\n\n\nthe dull monotony of the days that have passed. When you were far, far, away”\n\n\n        “Well as you remember the promise I made to you, I now ask you the question will you be my wife? and will you name the day when we can be married?” inquired William.\n\n\n        “I will, with mother and father’s consent” said Ella. “The [gh]shall be, Christmas day.”\n\n\n        “Well we will go into the sitting room and ask your father and mother’s sanction” They went into the sitting room and to their joy found Mr. and, Mrs. Armstead alone in the room. William felt a little abashed but he was determined to ask their consent.\n\n\n        “Well you two look very serious” said Mr. Armstead addressing William and Ella as they entered the room. “What is the matter now?”\n\n\n        William in his feeble way managed to state the “condition of affairs.” as soon as William finished, Mr. Armstead said: “I dont see where I can raise any any objection any objection. you have my consent I assure you. you are wo worthy of her and I am happy to say I am confident She will prove herself worthy of you.”\n\n\n        William was happy now now. he dreamed of the days w when he would be a husband when he went to Sleep that night.\n\n\n[PAGE 443: SC0313_Ms_424]\n\n\n        the following day being sunday he again visited his parents. Ella accompanied him and he was happy to announce the fact that he was engaged to be married to the last named lady. his father, mother, and sister congratulated him upon his choice. That day also passed pleasantly, as it always did with William when he was near Ella. \n\n\nWe will see how Herbert is getting along with his lady-love. Herbert took Mattie to Millbrooke in as fine a buggy as he could procure at one of the Livery Stables as he had sold his h horse and buggy.\n\n\nBertie had “weighty matters of importance” to communicate to Mattie. As the morning drive to Brookland was a the best opportunity he would have for pleading his cause.\n\n\n“Mattie I have waited as long as I can” began William Herbert. “Will you be my wife and n name the day when I can call you mine?” \n\n\n“Yes” said Mattie blushingly. “And the day Shall be of your own choice.”\n\n\n“Let it be Christmas-day then” asserted Herbert. They spoke many loving loving words But for fearing of tiring the reader we will omit recording them. It was late in the \n\n\n[PAGE 444: SC0313_Ms_425]\n\n\nafternoon when Herbert and Mattie returned.\n\n\n        “Bertie have you noticed how melancholy father is?” inquired Mattie as the [gi]drove leisurely along. “Mother has not forgiven him as he asked her and I beleive he will attempt suicide if she does not forgive him.”\n\n\n        “I have noticed him.” answered Herbert. “But I don’t think any serious trouble will arise. I hope not anyway” They were at the house by this time, and Herbert assisted Mattie out of the buggy and then proceeded to the stable with his horse intending to feed him before going to Winchester He unharnessed the horse leisurely — Mattie’s words concerning her father soon passed from the young man’s mind.\n\n\n        He took his horse into the stable and fed him. as he started out of the stable he heard a stifled moan. as of some one strangling. Presently he heard a box or barrel fall over. in the sound came from over-head. Herbert went hastily up the ladder to the “chopping-room”\n\n\n        He started back aghast as the sight that met his gaze, for there was Mr. Sowers — the man he intended making his father-in-law — hanging by the neck from a beam. he was apparently quite “Dead!”\nChapter XXXVIII\n\n\n[PAGE 445: SC0313_Ms_426]\n\n\n        From the Ancient to the present date, Suicide has appeared to some people as an egress by which they may escape all earthly trouble– they think that by tying a rope to a beam; that is one end of the rope, and tying the other end around their neck they can step up on a box tie the rope up very short and kicking the box from under them go to where the “wood-bine” twineth in less “nor no time” as the trapper says. I will venture to say: that is a mistaken idea they have got. It is something like the ideas our modern murderers have; ^(as) soon ^(as) they commit a murder they are prepared to die to be brief; muder seems to be the road to heaven. That is not my idea at all. \n\n\n        But to return to the subject of the preceding chapter— Herbert took in the situation at a glance. He soon recovered from his presence of mind and ran to Sowers and cut the rope. Taking care\n\n\n[PAGE 446: SC0313_Ms_427]\n\n\nto lay Sowers down on the floor as easily as possible. Herbert used every effort conceivable to bring the sinful old man back to consciousness. The vital spark of life had almost gone out. \n\n\n        Herbert was working with the energy bordering on despair when he was rewarded at last for his unrelaxing efforts to bring the old man from the “ wood-bine regions.” Sowers opened his eyes and looking around for awhile he realized his critical situation. he glanced at, and recognized Herbert sitting at his side. \n\n\n        “Oh Herbert!” exclaimed the old man as soon as he could speak. “ In what way shall I reward you for your kindness? I was not worth cutting down. I have been a desperate man! I have heard some say revenge is sweet but I can’t see it in that light– for I attempted to avenge my-self for apparent wrong when I had that boy stolen. and I’ll confess Herbert It was, a miserable reveng Revenge! how can I reward you for the \n\n\n[PAGE 447: SC0313_Ms_428]\n\n\ntimely assistance you rendered me?” \n\n\n        “Simply by not mentioning it”  replied Herbert. “Your daughter Mattie—, God bless her– told me that she believed you would commit suicide if your wife did not forgive you. Though I have powerful nerve, I should have ran away from this stable and left you hanging I would have been so frightened had not your dear daughter warned me. Mr. Sowers are you aware of the fact that Mattie is dearest to me than any other living being?” \n\n\n        “ No I was not aware of the fact.”  said Sowers. “ But if you want her, take her. You are worthy of her dear boy. I hope you may live and lead a happy life with her.” \n\n\n        “Thank you sir for your kind wishes”  said Herbert. “ I am living in anticipation of calling her my own dear wife soon:  Now Mr. Sowers you must brave this out. I will stand by you in all troubles and trials. You must become reconciled to your wife, and at once this suspense will kill you or drive you mad. Come and I will try to effect a reconciliation between you.” \n\n\n[PAGE 448: SC0313_Ms_429]\n\n\nSo, saying the young man rose and went with old man from the stable to the house. Mrs. Sowers, and Mattie were in the parlor entertaining their company when Herbert and the old man entered. \n\n\n        We must have the reader understand this much in regard to the lady formerly called Mrs. Barton, now Miss, Baker.  She was still staying at Sowers’. since the rain she had not been staying at her house although it was near. In fact Doctor Maltby had asked Mrs. Sowers to persuade his “ dear Jennie” to stay at Mr. Sowers’ house. Mrs Sowers did so. Miss, Baker did not seem to regret her husband’s sudden and fearful death. She was sure, he and his amiable (?) daughter had fallen on easy prey to the furious waters of the once quiet– now raging. stream\n\n\n        All her thoughts were. “ If I had not married him I would have been a happier person than what I am. But I do not regret that I have obeyed a mother’s dying wish. Oh if William will only come and take me how happy I will be!”  She never breathed a word of this to anyone. \n\n\n        It was only in the silence of her bed-chamber that she mused upon this subje subject. She formed was one of the guests\n\n\n[PAGE 449: SC0313_Ms_430]\n\n\nthat Mrs and Miss Sowers, were entertaining when Herbert and the old man entered the parlor. “Not now Herbert” whispered the old man “Wait until a more convenient season.”\n\n\n        “All right sir.” said Herbert in a low voice. They approached the group and were welcomed by Mr. Armstead. he had been sitting there idle for some time. as Sowers had been out for at least an hour. Mrs. Sowers was afraid something was wrong but she didn’t say anything in regard to Sowers’ staying out so long. If the truth is stated, she loved sowers with all her heart. It pained her now to act so unforgivingly and treat him so cool, yet she knew she was deceived by him for when Sowers asked her the all-important question he told her that she was his first love. She soon left the room after Sowers and Herbert came. She made a gesture to him to follow her. Herbert went with the old man for he had resolved to see them reconciled to one another. Mrs. Sowers went into the sitting room as it was called. She casted furtive glances at Herbert but Herbert was not all abashed. he had made up his \n\n\n[PAGE 450: SC0313_Ms_431]\n\n\nmind to do a good deed for the old man and he was not going to be thwarted in his purpose. we have been disregarding our old friend the genial Mr. Kent. He spent the Sabbath in Winchester with Mr. Beverly. He returned to Brookland, and came into the Sowers’ mansion just as Herbert and Sowers left the parlor, he bowed politely as he passed them. he also noticed the pallor of Sowers’ face. \n\n\n        Mrs. Sowers went into the sitting room, Sowers, and Herbert fast following behind. \n\n\n        “Mrs. Sowers,” said Herbert apologetically “I hope you will not consider my intrusion an insult. I have come in behalf of your husband. he will go mad if you do not forgive him. So please think better of him and forgive him.”\n\n\n        “I am much obliged to you for your advice.” said Mrs. Sowers. “I have treated my husband very bad. I freely forgave him from the first but refrained telling him.” then turning to Sowers she said: “I freely forgive all but you must thank Herbert for I have done as he advised. I will be the same loving confiding wife, I have always been my heart has been aching those few days— I wanted so bad to tell you I \n\n\n[PAGE 451: SC0313_Ms_432]\n\n\nforgave you. and but for Herbert’s kind words I do not beleive I should have told you that I forgave you.”\n        “Thank heaven! you have at last forgiven me” said Sowers “I will try to be a better man and lead a better life” said Sowers. \n\n\n        They then returned to the parlor. Supper was soon announced and they went promptly to the dining room. William and Ella came in just as the other guests were taking their seats. at the supper table. they had supped with Mr. and Mrs. Beverly at the Taylor, Hotel. So they went, at once to the parlor. \n\n\n        “Well Ella we have had a nice time today.” asserted William after they were comfortably seated in the parlor. “I have really enjoyed myself with my new-found parents”\n\n\n        “Well your parents are certainly nice people” said Ella. “And your sister is a model for other girls to ‘go’ by”\n\n\n        “I was surprised to see Hugh Walters” said William. “Hugh is smitten at last. If sister does fall in love with him she and he with her they have my consent to get married. Albert casts ‘sheep’s eyes’ at Annie Walters too.”\n\n\n[PAGE 452: SC0313_Ms_433]\n\n\n        “That will be a match” asserted Ella “I am thinking; the ministers of Boston will have a great many Virginians to marry. We will get married in Boston”\n\n\n        “Yes we will..” said ^(William) Herbert “Well isn’t Kent a pleasant man? he is always ready to talk. I am very favorably impressed with him. he shall be rewarded for his service. for he has found my parents for me. I will not forget them when I get to Boston. father has promised to buy a house and lot in Boston and make him a present of them. also he shall be rewarded with money. he is coming now”\n\n\n        Kent at that moment entered the room. \n\n\n        “You have got here I see” said he as he took a seat “Well William. I spent a pleasant day today with your parents.”\n\n\n        “I don’t think I ever spent more a day more pleasantly than I did this one” asserted William. “Mr. Kent when do you expect to go home?”\n\n\n        “Tomorrow morning I must make a start as I settled this business” said Kent \n\n\n        “No I can’t go tomorrow. I must stay until Wilse. Reed’s body is found, for I must be sure Wilse, alias Fred is dead.”\n\n\n[PAGE 453: SC0313_Ms_434]\n\n\n“yes that will detain you for a few days” said Ella. “The water has been so very high I wouldn’t be surprised if the two bodies floated down to the mouth of the Opequon creek. however we will hear something of it when the weekly paper is issued”\n\n\n        “William your sister is captured” said Kent after a slight pause “Hugh Walters has let Cupid’s arrow peirce his heart at last. but I don’t blame him, for your sister is so pretty; any person would love her. She is also a kind person to the poor. I have known them for a long while and I don’t beleive there is a den in Boston that she has not been in. She knows every thief in Boston and she is so kind to them; that she causes them to turn from their evil ways and try to make an honest living”\n\n\n        “I am glad to hear you speak so favorably of her” said William. “I thought she was a kind-hearted, Puritan like lady She is a sister that any man is proud to have. any man would be glad to call her his sister. for she is so pleasant. so [crossed out word] kind and loving that \n\n\n[PAGE 454: SC0313_Ms_435]\n\n\nthat she makes anyone happy”\n\n\n        “I know one man that would not be proud of her as a sister.” said Kent “Not if affairs were the same as they are present.”\n\n\n        “You mean Hugh Walters do you?” inquired William “Oh yes you are right. Hugh would rather her stand in be a stranger than to be his sister”\n\n\n        The other guests and also the host came in and then followed a lively conversation the evening soon slipped by. bedtime came and all sank to rest in their several rooms. The next day was a clear day. The water had fell to its right place. not a single timber of the mill remained. Mr. Hardin, came out to see how his farm looked after the rain\n\n\n        “I wont have the trouble of moving the mill” said he jokingly as he viewed the site where the mill once stood. \n\n\n        “And there were two lives lost by the falling of the mill Eh?”\n\n\n        “Yes they would go in there” said Sowers “If a person will go headlong to their own destruction, let them go”\n\n\n        Sowers spoke bravely but he thought at the time, of his failure to take\n\n\n[PAGE 455: SC0313_Ms_436]\n\n\nhis own life. Herbert had never mentioned mentioned the fact to anyone; that he rescued Sowers from the gallows. for it was nothing less than the gallows. Sowers asked him – yes begged him to keep it secret. \n\n\n        Herbert had promised to do so. \n\n\n        Mr and Mrs. Armstead went home that day. so did Herbert and Ella. they were preparing for their journey eastward. They wanted to start the first of October if possible. Kent waited patiently until the paper was issued. he was eager to see his family. all he was waiting for was to hear of Wilse Reed’s body being found. The report had been widely circulated that Wilse and Kate had been drowned when the Brookland mill washed away. no explanation had been given as to the reason of their being in the mill when the water was so high. Friday morning came. That was the day the paper was issued. \n\n\n        Kent rode up to Winchester and bought a copy of the Times he searched eagerly for the notice concerning. Fred, Lambert\n\n\n[PAGE 456: SC0313_Ms_437]\n\n\nHe finally found the paragraph, he was looking for. he read eagerly as follows: \n\n\n        “From the Jefferson Journal; we clip the following: “on Sunday, 24th just a child of Mr. Brown an esteemed citizen. Was fishing at the mouth of the Opequon creek when he was frightened into fits by seeing the body of a man suddenly come up out of the water. his scream was heard and Some one soon went to his assistance. When the little fellow got ‘all right again’ he pointed to the man who was still floating around in an eddy of the creek. presently a woman “popped” up out of the water. The bodies were hooked out and they had the appearance of being in the water for some time. an old man here, Pete Griffin by the name identified the body of the man as that of one Wilson. Reed. of Brookland mills. The other body is unknown. They will be as well taken care of as possible. The people intend putting them on ice for a few days. any one having an interest will please call as soon as possible”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX\n\n\n[PAGE 457: SC0313_Ms_438]\n\n\n        “I will go down there this very day.” said Kent as soon as he finished reading the paragraph. So saying he he started out of Winchester, he made his horse walk briskly until he reached Brookland. he stopped there a short while. William consented to accompany him on his long and tedious journey so they rode briskly away. Willie knew exactly where Mr. Brown the “esteemed citizen” lived so he acted as Kent’s guide.\n\n\n        It was a clear day and comparatively a cool one. The two rode along very briskly. It was only nine o’clock when they started, and they expected to reach the termination of their journey by three o’clock in the afternoon. a fine day, two brisk horses, and, a comparatively good road to rid [gj]on. What needed they to fear?\n\n\n        “This is the hollow you found cousin Albert in.” said William as they rode along through Ash Hollow, “Where was he laying when you found him?”\n\n\n[PAGE 458: SC0313_Ms_439]\n\n\n        “He was laying down beside that large Oak tree yonder.” answered Kent. \n        \n        “Well Mr. Kent we have got a good, long ride before us” said William. “We must make our noble steeds move along pretty fast, or we will be late getting to the residence of the ‘esteemed citizen’.”\n\n\n        “Yes we must move along fast” said Kent. “I must settle this business, and go home. I want to start when you start. When do you start? have you fixed upon a certain day?”\n\n\n        “You mean all of us including the Walters’, Armstead’s, Sowers’ and my Aunt, Mrs. King?” inquired William.\n\n\n        “Yes I mean all of you New Englanders” said Kent. “When are you going to start?”\n\n\n        “We have decided to start, Monday morning” said William. “I hope you will be ready to start at the same time. Let see, this is, the 29th. of September, we start on the second of October. Kent I am going to make you a present of five thousand dollars in gold when I get\n\n\n[PAGE 459: SC0313_Ms_440]\n\n\nto Boston and get settled. you have done me a great kindness. you have restored me to my right and real parents. I shall always be grateful for your kindness. I shall always be your friend.”\n\n\n        “I am glad to have you, as my friend” said Kent “But I ask no reward for my services. I only did my duty and I was a long while doing that. I ask no recompense for my services. so don’t say anything more about it. I have only done my duty.”\n\n\n        “I will have my way in this Mr. Kent” said William. “I will give you the money whether you ask it or not,”\n\n\n        “Well have it your way” consented Kent. “But I ask nothing of you. I was sent here to capture the intended assassin of Mattie sowers. I have done so. I was also told by the cheif to watch out for Fred Lambert I did so, and I have trapped both he and his daughter. I get a regular salary from headquarters as I have been in the service for a good many years. Sowers will have me to pay if I choose to charge him for my services. but I guess I’ll not charge him anything.”\n\n\n[PAGE 460: SC0313_Ms_441]\n\n\n        “Well I am just as happy as man can be, since I have been restored to my parents.” said William.\n\n\n        “Parents are always what is wanted, p to bring pure happiness.” responded Kent, “By the way William the place where you are going to live in Boston is the finest part of the City. Commercial, Street, is a unrivaled, both for business and the neatness of It’s buildings. Where are you going to live when you get married? I suppose you will will take a bridal trip to Europe?”\n\n\n        “I expect I will.” said William, smiling. “When I return I shall buy one of the finest mansion the City of Boston affords.”\n\n\n        “If it does not afford a mansion fine enough I suppose you will build one.” said Kent half-mischeviously:\n\n\n        “I will indeed.” said William, determined to be as sarcastic as Kent.\n\n\n        They rode along. talking as they rode. at twelve o’clock they stopped by the road-side and nested their horses while they a ate a luncheon. They did not forget their horses so they let them graze a little, along the rod road as there was good grass.\n\n\n        After After refreshing themselves and  letting there letting their horses graze awhile,\n\n\n[PAGE 461: SC0313_Ms_442]\n\n\nthey resumed their journey. Their journey lay over hills, and hollows, and after three hours’ more of brisk riding they “drew up” before the door of the “esteemed citizen.” Mr. Brown came out to see what they wanted. he was a portly florid faced gentleman, and he walked with a dignified step.\n\n\n        “Pleasant evening gentlemen.” said Mr. Brown with a polite bow.\n\n\n        “Pleasant evening sir” said Kent and William “I came on business Mr Brown.” said Kent as he took the Winchester Times from his pocket. and pointed to the notice of the man and woman being found.\n\n\n        Are you their relatives or friends.?” inquired Mr. Brown, after reading the notice.\n\n\n        “We are not relatives of those persons.” said William. “But we must bear no malice toward the dead. Therefore we are friends.”\n\n\n        “Well you came too late to see them.” asserted Mr. Brown. “They are buried now in the village grave yard.”\n\n\n        “We must see them. It is my duty” said Kent imperatively.\n\n\n        “I tell you they have been buried nearly a week? you cannot see them.”\n\n\n[PAGE 462: SC0313_Ms_443]\n\n\n        “I insist.” asserted Kent. “They must be dug up — taken out of the ground. The man must, if not the woman. It is my duty.” Kent put powerful emphasis on the last four words.\n\n\n        “If you must, and It is your duty” assented Mr. Brown, “I will go with you at once, for I want to be there when they are taken up. great consternation was caused here when they bounced up and floated along in the water. my boy came near being frightened to death. we were all feeling pretty cheap. I will go with you at once.”\n\n\n        “In order to convince you that it is my duty to have those bodies taken up,” said Kent. “I will show you this” As, Kent spoke he displayed his shining badge. Mr. Brown glanced at it, paled, and seemed to be in a greater hurry than ever.\n\n\n        “All right sir. your request shall be complied with at once” said Mr. Brown. “Come Dick hurry up with my horse!”\n\n\n        “All right massa” came from the stable.\n\n\n        In a few minutes they were off for the graveyard. They soon arrived there. Mr. Brown summoned the sexton who lived hard by.\n\n\n        “What in the world do you want to take them poor critters up for?” inquired the\n\n\n[PAGE 463: SC0313_Ms_444]\n\n\nsexton excitedly: “Poor things they have had tossin’ enough in the water. now they ought to be lef’ alone. They are where the wicked cease to trouble and the weary are at rest, let ‘em rest.”\n\n\n        “Come my man” said Kent. “We didn’t send for you to preach a funeral, but to open a grave. be quick now and open it explanations can be made afterwards. give me the shovel, I was once a sexton myself. I can soon finish this unpleasant work.” so saying, Kent took the shovel and worked away as fast as he could.\n\n\n        The grave was soon opened and an unpleasant odor came out, but Kent was not a man that would shrink from, duty.\n\n\n        He opened the coffin and reme vewe viewed the remains.\n\n\n        “Come here William.” said he, “Look at the body. you will swear it is the body of Wilson Reed, alias Fred Lambert?”\n\n\n        “I will” said William. “Anyone can see that is the body of Wilson my pretended father. close the coffin and have it lowered for It is horrible to poor fellow, he was always good and kind to me.”\n\n\n[PAGE 464: SC0313_Ms_445]\n\n\n        “Lower the body.” said Kent as soon as he had closed and fastened the coffin. “Now for the explanation.” said Kent. “That is the remains of one of the most notorious highwaymen that ever infested the fastnesses of Massachusetts.”\n\n\n        “He was?” inquired Mr. Brown “Well who is the girl? are you not going to ta take her up to see if you can identify her?”\n\n\n        “The girl is his daughter” said Kent “We will not take her up, just give me her description, I will know then what to do.” Mr. Brown gave an accurate description of the girl. he also referred to another notice in the Times. a notice Kent had not seen. “I am satisfied.” said Kent. “I will tell you something more about the man before I go away” added he as they rode back to the residence of the esteemed citizen. “You will stay at my house till morning will you?” inquired the hospitable Mr. Brown. “It is too late for you to start home this afternoon. just come to my house and make yourself at home while you are there. we don’t often see detectives in this part of the country. you can start home early in the morning if you are in a hurry. if not, why stay until\n\n\n[PAGE 465: SC0313_Ms_446]\n\n\nnext week. By-the-way we have had plenty of rain lately. the river has been very high.”\n\n\n        Kent and William was pleased with the hospitable way in which they were treated. When the morning came, their host called them so as they could start on their homeward journey early. They started at five in the morning and reached Brookland at two. They were both very tired so they took a nap pretty soon after they arrived. Only a short nap though, for there was a great deal of work to do, baggage to to be attended to, business to settle and so on. they were to start on their journey east on Monday morning. all of their business was to be finished Saturday evening. All was finished and all the New, Englanders were ready for their journey.\n\n\nSunday came. William was then staying at the hotel with his parents, the sabbath day passed quietly away and Monday came bright and clear. Brookland was to be deserted that day. At ten o’clock all of our Brookland friends were seated in the cars. Mrs. King, Mr. Beverly and family, and all of our characters were seated in\n\n\n[PAGE 466: SC0313_Ms_447]\n\n\nthe cars. The train started on its journey. We will see how our young men are getting along. Hugh Walters, asked Miss, Dora Beverly the privilege of taking a seat by her side She of course granted that privilege. soon an interesting conversation took place. Hugh could hold out no longer so he said in a low pleading voice: “Miss Beverly will you grant me the privilege of visiting you as a suitor for your hand when you reach your Eastern house?”\n\n\n        “Yes-sir” said Dora, while her cheeks were suffused with blushes. Then they began their courtship. we will also visit Albert as he sits by the side of Annie, Walters. he too is thinking of “Love in a cottage” He in his timid bashful way asked Miss Annie to allow him the privilege of visiting her at her residence as a lover!\n\n\n        She grants him that privilege, and he can hardly restrain himself from pressing her to his heart in the presence of her parents. however he controls his feelings, but his heart feels “big.” he feels like pouring forth words of love in the ear of her who has granted him the privilege of visiting her as a lover.\n\n\n        The train flies on, carrying them to their\n\n\n[PAGE 467: SC0313_Ms_448]\n\n\ndestinations. The conductor cries out: “Harpers-ferry!” and all get out and “change” cars. Then the cars starts again, on, on, on, they speed. but nothing attracts “Al’s” attention but the sweet melodious voice of Annie Walters. He loves her. there is not the least doubt about that. He was once a trifling revengeful man, now he was a kind, forgiving, gentle, man. he might have always been a vagabond had he not caught sight of this face and realized its beauty and innocence. after realizing the beauty and innocence of the face of Annie Walters, Albert King determined to change his course of life. he did so, and he was not sorry for it, for hadn’t she accepted him as a suitor for her heart and hand? of course she had.\n\n\n        Well, the weary travel days went slowly by. Never were days spent happier then those were to Albert, he had known no better days. Doctor Maltby was still living in anticipation of Wedding Jennie Baker. Mrs, Sowers, and also Mrs. King took all their colored people with them. so none none of the “New\n\n\n[PAGE 468: SC0313_Ms_449]\n\n\nEnglanders” were left behind.\n\n\nArriving at New. York, our friends took the steamer Narraganset for Boston.\n\n\n        “We are near the end of our journey.” said William. “We will be in port by tomorrow morning. Ella are you getting tired of traveling” inquired William addressing his lady-love.\n\n\n        “Well I had as leave stop a while as we have been traveling for sometime now.” answered Ella. “We are to land at the foot of Commercial street are we?”\n\n\n        “That is the place.” said William.\n\n\n        So, the boat plowed on through the briny waters, our friends had had very nice weather to travel in. the day drew to a close. our friends went to their “bunks” to dream of the city they expected to see on the following morning.\n\n\n        After a peaceful sleep of considerable duration our friends were waked suddenly by the captain calling out that the boat was at the landing. They needed no second calling, all got out of their bunks at once.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XL\n[PAGE 469: SC0313_Ms_450]\n\n\n        What remains to be said will be said briefly. On Commercial Street there was a fine row of brick houses. In a few days after the events detailed in our last Chapter anyone passing along could see the following names on the front door of each house: “John S. Beverly.” “Joshua. Sowers.” “Benjamin H. Walters.” “Mrs. Phillip. King” and “John H. Armstead.” Doctor Maltby retired from practice, as he was immensely rich. He took up his abode with his sister, Mrs. Beverly. He was still clinging to the hope of winning Miss, Baker. he knew she truly, devotedly loved him, and oh how his heart ached when he saw the tears which he knew were tears of anguish standing in her eyes. he avoided her as much as possible. Why was this thus? The answer is It was for love, for aside from his sister he loved no other human being but Jane. Baker. \n\n\n[PAGE 470: SC0313_Ms_451]\n\n\nWilliam. Beverly, our hero, was one of the happiest of men he was really contented, that was more than most people could say. All William was looking anxiously forward to was Christmas. The day when he was to lead Ella Armstead to the altar and there make his vows to love. honor and protect her. The next one of the happy men was Herbert Armstead, a hero in himself a gentleman in every sense. he was perfectly happy, and living in anticipation of leading Mattie Sowers to the altar. and she? well she was in perfect ecstacy. Our Bertie came every day to see his lady-love. It was his only real source of enjoyment. \n\n\n        What was Hugh Walters doing? \n\n\n        Why he was making steady progress, in his love making, he called at the residence of Mr. Beverly more than once a week. “you bet!” he did. \n\n\n        The fifteenth of October came. \n\n\n        Our friends were well fixed in their\n\n\n[PAGE 471: SC0313_Ms_452]\n\n\nnew homes. We must visit Kent this day as it is Sunday and he is at leisure. We enter and find him sitting by his fireside for the October air is cool. Who is that sitting in a chair near him?  It is William, our genial hero. \n\n\n        “Well Mr Kent we open our new Commission house tomorrow.” asserted William as he leisurely smoked a fragrant Havana of the best make. \n\n\n        “So I heard” responded kent. “What is the name of the firm?”\n\n\n        “‘Beverly, Walters, Armstead, &co.’” replied William. “What do you think of it?”\n\n\n        “Oh the name will do very well” said Kent “And I hope the people will do well. I suppose you are one of the firm. You have taken your father’s place haven’t you?”\n\n\n        “Yes I will do all the work that is left for father. I will attend to all the affairs of the firm in general.” said William “Oh yes Kent. I was requested by someone to tell you to be at the Commission, House by seven o’clock tomorrow morning please be there.”\n\n\n[PAGE 472: SC0313_Ms_453]\n\n\n        “I’ll be there punctual to the minute. but I would like to know who the ‘some one’ is” asserted kent. \n\n\n        “You will find out when you get there.” said William. “I must go now. Good-bye all. Be sure to come tomorrow morning at seven.”\n\n\n        “Good-day William.” said Kent. “I’ll be there. I wish you a happy day with your intended.” William laughed and walked off briskly toward his home, which he was the light and sunshine of. \n\n\n        “What can they want of you?” inquired Mrs. Kent, a middle aged matron, and Kent’s better half. \n\n\n        “They are going to make me a present of a good sum of money I think” asserted Kent. “I didn’t tell you wife. I have had the promise of five thousand, from William and a good round sum from Mr. Beverly. I’ll bet that is  what they want with me tomorrow morning.”\n\n\n        “Why we will be rich!” said Mrs. Kent. \n\n\n        “Well– we are not really poor now.” saud Kent. “I can start my boy in business with that money. Well I do not feel as if I deserve a cent of that money. for I was so awfully long in restoring\n\n\n[PAGE 473: SC0313_Ms_454]\n\n\nWilliam to his parents.”\n\n\n        They talked for some time on this topic. but their talk we are afraid will not interest the reader. so, we will see how the love-sick doctor is getting along. Miss Baker came to Mrs Beverly’s on Sunday morning to “spend” the day.\n\n\n        By chance, she and the doctor were left alone in the parlor. all was still in that parlor for some, fifteen minutes the doctor was afraid to look up for fear Miss Baker was looking at him. \n\n\n        She was acting “ditto” Finally the doctor raised his eyes and they rested on the face of “Jennie”. his dear Jennie. \n\n\n        She raised her eyes shyly and looked at him. There was such an unutterable countenance that Miss Jennie could not refrain shedding tears. \n\n\n        “Jennie you love me. Do you?”\n\n\n        “I do William with all my heart!” answered the sorrow-stricken lady. \n\n\n        “Oh William my heart is breaking every day! To see you who loves me so well debarred from me. by, my marriage with \n\n\n[PAGE 474: SC0313_Ms_455]\n\n\n-a-a-murderer! Oh god! My heart will break! I can restrain an outburst of tears no longer. William I have tried to avoid you but I love you so well I cannot. I was married to a man with a false name! Could the marriage be called legal when my marriage certificate was signed:  ‘Barton’ instead of ‘Lambert’?”\n\n\n        “No! No! Love it could not be legal!”crid cried the doctor as he bounded forward and clasped her to his breast “You are mine! Were always mine! And shall be mine henceforth, until death do us part!”\n\n\n        “Oh if I could in honor marry you! Oh that we could be united, never to part again! I would be happy— unspeakably happy!” said Miss Baker as she imprinted kiss after kiss upon the doctor’s cheeks.\n\n\n        “We must be married.” said the doctor. “I cannot live without you, you are the only object in life that I wish to live for, and I must and will marry you. Name the day dear Jennie. Say Christmas. if not sooner. your answer your answer” continued the doctor with breathless anxiety. “Say yes It Shall be Christmas. for god’s sake say yes!”\n\n\n[PAGE 475: SC0313_Ms_456]\n\n\n“Yes I shall be Christmas, for I cannot exist without you, you are my life. Without you I would die!” said Jennie. \n\n\n        “God be thanked.” muttered the doctor as he pressed her still nearer his heart. “Heaven be praised I have at last been made happy.” continued the doctor. “Roll on time! Let Christmas come so as I can be made the happiest of all men!”\n\n\n        “What have I done?” said Miss Baker. “I have promised to marry you Christmas”\n\n\n        “You do not regret it do you?” asked the doctor. “Oh tell me! do you regret it?”\n\n\n        “I do not regret it” said Jennie. some one was heard coming so the lovers took seats some distance apart.\n\n\n        The rest of the day passed happily to the doctor. he took a drive over to Charlestown with Miss Baker, and he breathed words of love in every breath. The sabbath passed. Monday morning came bright and clear. Kent was at the store at precisely seven o’clock. he found the doctor, Mr. Beverly’s senior and junior, also Mr. Sowers at the office. \n\n\n        Kent walked in and was welcomed by all.\n\n\n[PAGE 476: SC0313_Ms_457]\n\n\n        Mr. Beverly opened his private desk. and drew out a little wallet. he then began counting ten, and twenty dollar gold peices. He counted out five thousand dollars and handed it to Kent. \n\n\n        “This I make you a present of. It is a poor recompense but it is the best this earth affords.” said Mr. Beverly. “I will always remember you as the deliverer you did all, you brought me around to where my child was. I cannot find words suitable to say to you.”\n\n\n        “This is a princely reward.” said Kent “I hardly know how to thank you for your kindness. I feel very grateful to you my dear sir. I looked for no reward. I did it as my duty”\n\n\n        William then stepped forward with a handful of “specie” or gold and silver. \n\n\n        “I make you a present of five thousand in gold and five hundred dollars in silver silver.” said William handing the money to Kent. Kent refused it. \n\n\n        “I do not deserve this money. I have not earned it” said Kent\n\n\n        “I make you a present of it Kent.” said William. “you must take it as a present from a friend.”\n\n\n[PAGE 477: SC0313_Ms_458] [Page torn; # mising]\n\n\nKent was obliged to take it. He was greatly surprised when Doctor Maltby handed him a deed, “entitling” him to a nice brick house on the end of the row before mentioned he hastily wended his way home. to tell his wife and children of his good fortune. \n\n\n        “Ten thousand dollars in cash and a fine brick mansion to boot” muttered he as he trudged along homeward. his wife almost fainted she was so happy in the thought of being rich. What was their surprise when they went to look at the house and found it furnished?  Their cup of joy was filled to over-flowing. Days went by. Kent was the representative of a firm under the name of: “Kent and Son” he chose grocery and market business and had all the custom of “Commercial Row”\n\n\n        Christmas time drew near. preparations were made for William and Ella’s marriage also Herbert and Mattie’s. and still another: Doctor; Maltby; and Jennie; Baker. Well the time came at last and those three gentlemen. and ladies were made\n\n\n[PAGE 478: SC0313_Ms_459]\n\n\nthe happiest of all human beings. \n\n\n        There were two other gentlemen who expected soon to go on a bridal tour, they were Hugh Walters and Albert King. Hugh had asked Dora the all important question and had been accepted. the wedd[Page torn; “ing”] was to take place some time in the Winter. William was to keep them well informed of his whereabouts in Europe and they were to go to Europe and stay awhile and all come home together. \n\n\n        Albert had also asked the all important question and was accepted. \n\n\n        The days flew by and soon came the wedding day of Hugh and Dora. Albert and Annie. they embarked on the Western Beauty for Europe land safely on the other shore. It was the early spring time and the weather was quite warm so our tourists had a pleasant time among old England’s sunny hills. \n\n\n        They returned home in the month of April and started to keeping house for themselves. There were five door-plates added to the former list. \n\n\n        Mrs. Doctor Maltby was happy indeed. She was now in the midst of \n\n\n[PAGE 479: SC0313_Ms_460]\n\n\nenjoyment. Such enjoyment as she had never before experienced. \n\n\n        Herbert still kept Sowers’ secret locked in his bosom. Albert King was a perfect gentleman. His mother was happy to see him so, she was happy to see her former wayward son a steady man at last. \n        \n        Hugh Walters was as ever a lover of fun. he was the life of “Commercial Row” and a happy life did he lead with beautiful Dora. \n\n\n        William, our hero, “a lad among a thousand lads.’ was perfectly happy. he carried on business for his father. The Commission house flourished, so did the grocery and market store, belonging to Kent. the detective. He resigned his position in the secret service and devoted his time to the welfare of his family. \n\n\n        “I owe my good fortune to you.” said kent to William when he saw him after his return from Europe. \n\n\n        “Oh no; not to me”said William “To your own industry my good fellow you owe all to your own industry.”\n\n\n[PAGE 480: SC0313_Ms_461]\n\n\n[Page torn; content missing] you may have it your way.” \n[Page torn; content missing]d Kent. “But you certainly\n[Page torn; content missing]e to do what I am now doing.”\n[Page torn; content missing]was seated in his room about\n[Page torn; content missing]ks after his return from\n[Page torn; content missing]nversing with is pretty little\n[Page torn; content missing]the time when he was a\n[Page torn; content missing]lived with Wilson.
