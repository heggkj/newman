Newman</u>.\n\nChapter I\n\nA finer estate than that of Joshua Sowers could not be found in all Virginia. We will not give the exact date, let it suffice for us to say we begin our story April the first, in a certain part of the nineteenth century. \n\nThe morning was a clear, beautiful one, We locate the scene of our story in the county of Frederick, a short distance from the then small town of Winchester. The estate was rightly named Brookland, for the land was covered with brooks. Mr. Sowers owned a large mill. It had had stood the storms of many years, and, to tell the truth, the old mill was beginning to look \u201crickety.\u201d\n\nThrough the centre of the estate flowed the largest stream, and it was of so much importance as to receive the name of \u201cAbram\u2019s creek.\u201d\n\nHalf a mile west of the mill there was a \u201cdam\u201d made in the creek; then a \u201crace\u201d or small canal led the water down to the",
    "SC0313_Ms_004": "mill, where it was used to run the great water-wheel, and then it was free again. Enough of this. We will see who the inhabitants of Brookland are.\n\nTwo young men are sauntering along the road that leads to the country church, which is about one mile from Brookland.\n\nWe will first describe them, and then listen at what they are talking about. Both had dark hair, dark eyes and fair complexion; they were tall and well built. They were so near alike that this was the common question asked as they passed a stranger: \u201cAren\u2019t they brothers?\u201d The answer was always \u201cno,\u201d if an acquaintance was near. Then the questioner would remark: \u201cWell they are the best lookin\u2019 \u201cpine-hillers\u201d I ever saw!\u201d\n\nNow for what those two young men are talking about. We must also choose a hero from these two \u201cpine-hillers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my last day at Brookland,\u201d said one of the young men, and as he speaks honestly, we choose him as our hero. His name is William G. Reed. \u201cI will start to Chicago tomorrow morning. I must go away from here, as I am making nothing.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so William,\u201d said William\u2019s companion Albert King by name.",

He had never known a mother, he had been partially raised in Berryville by a man he thought was his father, Wilson Reed by name. There was some mystery connected with his parentage, a mystery he could not solve.\n\nHe was an amiable young man, much respected by all who knew him. Our hero and his companion were at last in sight of the church. Albert stopped suddenly and seemed to be in",

Whether he was a gentleman in principle or not, we shall find out bye-and-bye.\n\nWe will not follow Albert in his wanderings for awhile. We will see what our hero is about. Arriving at the church he concluded he would sit down awhile under a large tree hard by, for the simple purpose of watching for a young lady he expected to see. He loved this young lady and he intended to tell her of his love before he left Brookland. He was compelled to ask her that day if she returned his love for he was to start for Chicago on the following day. he seated himself under the tree in question and \u201cwatched and waited\u201d to see",

After services were over William asked his lady to walk down to Mrs. Barton\u2019s residence with him She consented to go. Mrs. Barton\u2019s residence was at Brookland. William boarded at her house. The lovers walked leisurely down to Brookland. William\u2019s heart was throbbing fast. \n\n         \u201cWillie I am sorry you are going away.\u201d asserted Ella Armstead \u2013 for such was the lady\u2019s name. \n\n\u201cYou are still determined to go?\u201d \n\n\u201cI am still determined to go.\u201d answered William. \u201cBut I hate to go.\u201d \u2013he grasped Ella\u2019s hand as he spoke. She didn\u2019t attempt to withdraw her hand. \u201cMiss Armstead \u2013 Ella \u2013 dear \u2013 Ella. Will you try to love me? I love you with all my heart. Will you try to love me? a little?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do love you dear Willie,\u201d answered Ella passionately. \u201cI love you as well as woman can love man. I am so sorry you are going away. I will feel so very lon lonesome while you are away.\u201d",
    "SC0313_Ms_008": "\u201cI must go love.\u201d said William as he clasped Ella to his breast.\n\nThey arrived at Brookland. after a slow walk. the day passed pleasantly, with William and Ella. Late in the evening William accompanied Ella home and reluctantly bid her farewell at the gate. \n\n \u201cAre you going to write to me Willie?\u201d inquired Ella as she stood as the yard-gate. \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I will or not.\u201d said William. \u201cI may go to California\u201d \n\n\u201cWell come back as soon as you can.\u201d asserted Ella. \u201cI want you to stay so bad! Oh Willie can\u2019t you stay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot stay dear.\u201d said William as he and Ella walked down the lane. They stopped under a large willow tree and William pressed her to his bosom. in the twilight of the evening he bid her farewell.\n\nHis heart was too full for utterance, so he gave her a loving kiss and unwillingly started for Brookland. Oh! how his heart ached as he walked briskly along toward Brookland he felt a a presentiment that he would not n never meet her again. Will he realize his presentiment? We trust not. When he arrived at Mrs. Barton\u2019s his supper was ready, and he sat",

She is off somewhere\u201d answered Mrs. Barton. \u201cShe has been away all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I wish Al was here\u201d said William as he arose from the table \u2013 \u201cWill you let your boy harness up a horse and take my trunk in to Winchester?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly I will\u201d said Mrs. Barton. \u201cJoe get the horse and wagon ready.\u201d\n \n\u201cYes Joe get it quick please. and I will give you half a dollar\u201d asserted William.\n\n\u201cAll right sah I will get \u2019em pretty quick.\u201d said Joe as he started off, greatly delighted to hear of receiving a reward for for his services.\n\n\u201cThere you are Kate\u201d said Mrs Barton as Kate at that moment came in. Kate was a flaxen haired sensible (?) girl. knew a little too much. \u201cWhere have you",
    "SC0313_Ms_011": "been all day? enjoying yourself somewhere? Well eat your supper for it is getting late.\u201d \n \u201cOld lady\u201d said Kate to herself after Mrs. Barton went out \u201cYou are not aware of the fact that I am playing a ___________\u201d\n\nShe did not finish the sentence for she was afraid she might be heard by some one. William came in to bid all of Mrs. Barton\u2019s family farewell. he bade them farewell and then went to the mill to get his trunk ready. While he is there or on his way there we will give a description of Ella Armstead. \n\nShe had raven tresses; that hung in pretty ringlets around her plump face. She had a beautiful complexion and was just the size to look sweet.\n\nWilliam went into his room at the mill and proceeded to the desk; not noticing his trunk at the time. But he noticed the window being hoisted; he then looked around at his trunk. what was his surprise when he perceived It was wide open; and his clothes was thrown out of It. The trunk was literally \u201cransacked.\u201d\n\nHe went to his trunk peremptorily, and began placing his things in his trunk again",
    "SC0313_Ms_012": "While he is fixing his effects we will visit Ella : She proceed to her the house as soon as William was out of sight. She had fearful forebodings that she would never see her \u201cdear Willie.\u201d again\n\nShe blushingly told her mother of the promise she had made to William.\n \u201cI hope you will keep your promise Ella\u201d was all her mother said.\n \u201cI will do so mother as long as I live. I shall never lose faith in William\u201d\n \u201cThat is the way to talk Ella\u201d said her mother approvingly.\n\nThe time intervening between sunset and bedtime soon passes with country people.\n Their motto is: \u201cEarly to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\u201d In most all cases country people stand to that rule, still there are some exceptions to all rules. Mr. Armstead and family retired early, as they expected to rise early the next morning.\n\nElla was thinking of William all that evening. So when She went to her room and prepared for bed she knelt, [as?]\nwas her custom, and prayed to the [Page torn; content missing]\nof all good. Prayed long and earnes[tly for?][b]\nthe welfare of her lover. We will [presently?]",
    "SC0313_Ms_013": "see what \u201cher lover\u201d is doing.\n\nHe placed his clothes in his trunk. he looked earnestly, but vainly for his best suit of clothes, they could not be found. his best shoes were also missing.\n\n\u201cWho could have taken my clothes?\u201d William asked himself. \u201cSome one has stolen my best suit of clothes, two shirts, and low quartered shoes. Well that beats all I ever witnessed. I\u2019ll say nothing about it to any-one as it will do no good to tell them now as the clothes are gone.\u201d So saying, he locked his trunk and carried it out on the mill porch.\n\nJoe soon had the wagon there, so, William put his trunk in and told Joe to drive on, pretty lively as he wished to get to town as soon as he could. Arriving at Winchester, at the \u201cTaylor Hotel,\u201d William gave Joe an ample reward for his services. William then went into the hotel. he had a room engaged, so, he went immediately up to it. he soon went to bed, he slept well and rose early. went immediately to the depot had his trunk checked and also",

Perhaps Albert was at home. Whoever It was that stole my clothes I hope they will never do any good with them. Mrs. Barton\u2019s words were strange, very strange. I never thought Albert was my enemy. I can\u2019t believe it now, for, he has always treated me right.\u201d\n\nIt was too late for William to wish now, for the \u201cIron horse\u201d was fast carrying him away, far away from those he loved. he was being carried to a good or evil destiny. It is hard to tell whether it was good or evil.\n\nOn, on sped the train, and so we part from William, to see him no more until returns. We go back to Brookland, and presumptously enter the proprietor\u2019s house.\n\nWe find him in bed. Listen! \n\nWhat does he say as he opens his eyes?",
