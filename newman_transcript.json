We will not give the exact date, let it suffice for us to say we begin our story April the first, in a certain part of the nineteenth century.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">The morning was a clear, beautiful one, We locate the scene of our story in the county of Frederick, a short distance from the then small town of Winchester. The estate was rightly named Brookland, for the land was covered with brooks. Mr. Sowers owned a large mill. It had had stood the storms of many years, and, to tell the truth, the old mill was beginning to look \"crickety.\"</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Through the centre of the estate flowed the largest stream, and it was of so much importance as to receive the name of \"Abram’s creek.\"</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Half a mile west of the mill there was a \"dam\" made in the creek; then a \"race\" or small canal led the water down to the</p>",

Enough of this. We will see who the inhabitants of Brookland are.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Two young men are sauntering along the road that leads to the country church, which is about one mile from Brookland.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">We will first describe them, and then listen at what they are talking about. Both had dark hair, dark eyes and fair complexion; they were tall and well built. They were so near alike that this was the common question asked as they passed a stranger: “Aren’t they brothers?” The answer was always “no,” if an acquaintance was near. Then the questioner would remark: “Well they are the best lookin’ “pine-hillers” I ever saw!”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Now for what those two young men are talking about. We must also choose a hero from these two “pine-hillers.”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“This is my last day at Brookland,” said one of the young men, and as he speaks honestly, we choose him as our hero. His name is William G. Reed. “I will start to Chicago tomorrow morning. I must go away from here, as I am making nothing.”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“That’s so William,” said William’s companion Albert King by name.</p>",

He had never known a mother, he had been partially raised in Berryville by a man he thought was his father, Wilson Reed by name. There was some mystery connected with his parentage, a mystery he could not solve.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">He was an amiable young man, much respected by all who knew him. Our hero and his companion were at last in sight of the church. Albert stopped suddenly and seemed to be in</p>",

We will see what our hero is about. Arriving at the church he concluded he would sit down awhile under a large tree hard by, for the simple purpose of watching for a young lady he expected to see. He loved this young lady and he intended to tell her of his love before he left Brookland. He was compelled to ask her that day if she returned his love for he was to start for Chicago on the following day. he seated himself under the tree in question and “watched and waited” to see</p>",

After services were over William asked his lady to walk down to Mrs. Barton’s residence with him She consented to go. Mrs. Barton’s residence was at Brookland. William boarded at her house. The lovers walked leisurely down to Brookland. William’s heart was throbbing fast.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Willie I am sorry you are going away.” asserted Ella Armstead – for such was the lady’s name.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“You are still determined to go?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“I am still determined to go.” answered William. “But I hate to go.” –he grasped Ella’s hand as he spoke. She didn’t attempt to withdraw her hand. “Miss Armstead – Ella – dear – Ella. Will you try to love me? I love you with all my heart. Will you try to love me? a little?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“I do love you dear Willie,” answered Ella passionately. “I love you as well as woman can love man.

Late in the evening William accompanied Ella home and reluctantly bid her farewell at the gate.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Are you going to write to me Willie?” inquired Ella as she stood as the yard-gate. \n \n“I don’t know whether I will or not.” said William. “I may go to California”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Well come back as soon as you can.” asserted Ella. “I want you to stay so bad!

They stopped under a large willow tree and William pressed her to his bosom. in the twilight of the evening he bid her farewell.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">His heart was too full for utterance, so he gave her a loving kiss and unwillingly started for Brookland.

Kate was a flaxen haired sensible (?) girl. knew a little too much. “Where have you</p>",

William came in to bid all of Mrs. Barton’s family farewell. he bade them farewell and then went to the mill to get his trunk ready. While he is there or on his way there we will give a description of Ella Armstead.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">She had raven tresses; that hung in pretty ringlets around her plump face. She had a beautiful complexion and was just the size to look sweet.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">William went into his room at the mill and proceeded to the desk; not noticing his trunk at the time. But he noticed the window being hoisted; he then looked around at his trunk. what was his surprise when he perceived It was wide open; and his clothes was thrown out of It. The trunk was literally “ransacked.”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">He went to his trunk peremptorily, and began placing his things in his trunk again</p>",

She had fearful forebodings that she would never see her “dear Willie.” again</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">She blushingly told her mother of the promise she had made to William.\n “I hope you will keep your promise Ella” was all her mother said.\n “I will do so mother as long as I live. I shall never lose faith in William”\n “That is the way to talk Ella” said her mother approvingly.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">The time intervening between sunset and bedtime soon passes with country people.\n Their motto is: “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” In most all cases country people stand to that rule, still there are some exceptions to all rules. Mr. Armstead and family retired early, as they expected to rise early the next morning.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Ella was thinking of William all that evening.

I’ll say nothing about it to any-one as it will do no good to tell them now as the clothes are gone.” So saying, he locked his trunk and carried it out on the mill porch.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Joe soon had the wagon there, so, William put his trunk in and told Joe to drive on, pretty lively as he wished to get to town as soon as he could. Arriving at Winchester, at the “Taylor Hotel,” William gave Joe an ample reward for his services. William then went into the hotel. he had a room engaged, so, he went immediately up to it. he soon went to bed, he slept well and rose early. went immediately to the depot had his trunk checked and also</p>",

Perhaps Albert was at home. Whoever It was that stole my clothes I hope they will never do any good with them. Mrs. Barton’s words were strange, very strange. I never thought Albert was my enemy. I can’t believe it now, for, he has always treated me right.”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">It was too late for William to wish now, for the “Iron horse” was fast carrying him away, far away from those he loved. he was being carried to a good or evil destiny.

Who is Hugh Walters? is he as much of a gentleman as he seems?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“All I can say in regard to Hugh is that he is a gentleman in every sense of the word,” answered William truthfully. “Why do you ask that question Sister?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Oh — well — just for curiosity.” stammered Dora a little taken aback by this unexpected question. “I think he is a kind-hearted young man. and he is so full of fun.”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Yes he always is.” asserted William. “Well there is Bertie, Armstead. what do you think of him? But hold on. for fear you may fall in love with him I will inform you of the fact that he is engaged to Mattie sowers. by-the-way how do you like her?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“To answer your first question.” said Dara. “I will say that Bertie is certainly a nice young man. as for me falling in love with him you need not fear of any harm resulting from that. Mattie is a very agreeable young lady. I feel sorry for her because of her father’s treachery in years past. I forgive him for keeping my brother away from me don’t you dear brother?” inquired Dora in conclusion.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Yes indeed.

So they sat down to enjoy the repast repast. After breakfast Mr. Beverly prepared to start for W Winchester. That day was a cloudy cheerless one, like it’s predecessor.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">William went to town with his relatives, including the doctor, Mrs. King, and Albert. He spent a pleasant day with them, returned home in the evening resolved to ask Ella to become his wife as he had now found his real name. he wanted the day named and also Mr. and Mrs. Armstead’s consent.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Mr. and Mrs. Armstead stayed at Brookland all that day and intended to stay until Monday morning. After supper was over, William to his great joy got a chance to speak to Ella in private.

William felt a little abashed but he was determined to ask their consent.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“Well you two look very serious” said Mr. Armstead addressing William and Ella as they entered the room. “What is the matter now?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">William in his feeble way managed to state the “condition of affairs.” as soon as William finished, Mr. Armstead said: “I dont see where I can raise any any objection any objection. you have my consent I assure you. you are wo worthy of her and I am happy to say I am confident She will prove herself worthy of you.”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">William was happy now now. he dreamed of the days w when he would be a husband when he went to Sleep that night.</p>",

That day also passed pleasantly, as it always did with William when he was near Ella.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">We will see how Herbert is getting along with his lady-love. Herbert took Mattie to Millbrooke in as fine a buggy as he could procure at one of the Livery Stables as he had sold his h horse and buggy.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">Bertie had “weighty matters of importance” to communicate to Mattie.

I hope not anyway” They were at the house by this time, and Herbert assisted Mattie out of the buggy and then proceeded to the stable with his horse intending to feed him before going to Winchester He unharnessed the horse leisurely — Mattie’s words concerning her father soon passed from the young man’s mind.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">He took his horse into the stable and fed him. as he started out of the stable he heard a stifled moan. as of some one strangling. Presently he heard a box or barrel fall over. in the sound came from over-head. Herbert went hastily up the ladder to the “chopping-room”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">He started back aghast as the sight that met his gaze, for there was Mr. Sowers — the man he intended making his father-in-law — hanging by the neck from a beam. he was apparently quite “Dead!”</p>",

That is not my idea at all.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">But to return to the subject of the preceding chapter— Herbert took in the situation at a glance.

Though I have powerful nerve, I should have ran away from this stable and left you hanging I would have been so frightened had not your dear daughter warned me. Mr. Sowers are you aware of the fact that Mattie is dearest to me than any other living being?”</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">“ No I was not aware of the fact.”  said Sowers. “ But if you want her, take her.

Mrs. Sowers, and Mattie were in the parlor entertaining their company when Herbert and the old man entered.</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">We must have the reader understand this much in regard to the lady formerly called Mrs. Barton, now Miss, Baker.  She was still staying at Sowers’. since the rain she had not been staying at her house although it was near. In fact Doctor Maltby had asked Mrs. Sowers to persuade his “ dear Jennie” to stay at Mr. Sowers’ house. Mrs Sowers did so. Miss, Baker did not seem to regret her husband’s sudden and fearful death. She was sure, he and his amiable (?) daughter had fallen on easy prey to the furious waters of the once quiet– now raging. stream</p><p style=\"text-indent:2em; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0.5em;\">All her thoughts were. “ If I had not married him I would have been a happier person than what I am.

They approached the group and were welcomed by Mr. Armstead. he had been sitting there idle for some time. as Sowers had been out for at least an hour. Mrs. Sowers was afraid something was wrong but she didn’t say anything in regard to Sowers’ staying out so long. If the truth is stated, she loved sowers with all her heart. It pained her now to act so unforgivingly and treat him so cool, yet she knew she was deceived by him for when Sowers asked her the all-important question he told her that she was his first love. She soon left the room after Sowers and Herbert came. She made a gesture to him to follow her. Herbert went with the old man for he had resolved to see them reconciled to one another. Mrs. Sowers went into the sitting room as it was called. She casted furtive glances at Herbert but Herbert was not all abashed. he had made up his</p>",

He was still clinging to the hope of winning Miss, Baker. he knew she truly, devotedly loved him, and oh how his heart ached when he saw the tears which he knew were tears of anguish standing in her eyes. he avoided her as much as possible.
